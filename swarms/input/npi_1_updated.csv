Additional taxonomies listed: 207R00000X Internal Medicine; 207RH0000X Hematology; 207RH0003X Hematology & Oncology.\\\\n- Mailing / Practice address on NPI-derived record(s): 200 HAWKINS DR, IOWA CITY, IA 52242-1009, USA.\\\\n- Practice phone (from NPI-derived record): 319-356-2353. Fax: 319-353-8383.\\\\n\\\\nAffiliation / employer / practice location evidence:\\\\n- University of Iowa Health Care / State University of Iowa appears as primary practice affiliation. Multiple directory pages (US News, Medicarelist, and local provider profiles) list her practicing at University of Iowa Health Care / State University of Iowa (practice NPI referenced on US News: 1477554814), consistent with the 200 Hawkins Dr address (University of Iowa Hospitals & Clinics address).\\\\n- Additional listed affiliation: Jefferson County Health Center (appears on US News profile as an affiliation as well).\\\\n\\\\nLicensure and dates found:\\\\n- US News lists an Iowa State medical license and states IA State Medical License active through 2027 (this is the only explicit license expiration/active-through date found in the captured pages).\\\\n- Training dates on US News: Residency Internal Medicine 1993-1996; Fellowship Hematology & Medical Oncology 1996-1998 (background, not licensing). CMS EHR Stage entries (2011-2013) appear on US News profile.\\\\n\\\\nSpecialty / department / role:\\\\n- Specialties listed across sources: Internal Medicine; Medical Oncology (primary taxonomy); Hematology; Hematology & Oncology. Some payer/provider directories list specialty as Adult/Internal Medicine and Hematology/Oncology.\\\\n- Departmentally, likely within University of Iowa Hospitals & Clinics \\u2014 Division/Department of Internal Medicine and/or Hematology/Oncology (no explicit departmental webpage captured in searches that lists department name and schedule).\\\\n\\\\nWorking hours / schedule:\\\\n- No working hours or clinic schedule were found in the captured pages.\\\\n\\\\nPhone numbers and addresses (captured):\\\\n- Practice address: 200 Hawkins Dr, Iowa City, IA 52242-1009 (NPI-derived and matches University of Iowa location).\\\\n- Practice phone: 319-356-2353. Fax: 319-353-8383.\\\\n\\\\nEvidence that information is current / provenance:\\\\n- NPI record (NPPES-derived viewers) listing NPI 1487615340 with current practice address and taxonomies \\u2014 authoritative for NPI-linked practice information.\\\\n- US News profile repeats NPI and lists IA license active through 2027 (provides an explicit license active-through date).\\\\n- Health Alliance / Medicarelist provider pages corroborate NPI and affiliation (University of Iowa / State University of Iowa) and specialties.\\\\n\\\\nNotes and limitations:\\\\n- I reached the maximum allowed Tavily search calls for this task; I did not query the Iowa Board of Medicine site directly (which would be the authoritative state board source) within these searches. US News lists the IA license active through 2027, but direct verification on the Iowa Board of Medicine licensure lookup is recommended for the authoritative license status and exact issuance/expiration dates.\\\\n- No explicit clinic department page with working hours or an official University of Iowa provider profile page (with last-updated timestamp) was captured within the five-search limit; directory pages and aggregated NPI viewers were the primary sources.\\\\n\\\\nRecommended next steps (if you want further verification):\\\\n1) Query the Iowa Board of Medicine license lookup for \\\\\\\""Susan L Roeder\\\\\\\"" (and former name Roman) to confirm active license details and dates.\\\\n2) Visit the official University of Iowa Health Care provider directory or departmental Hematology/Oncology faculty/provider pages to confirm departmental affiliation, role/title, and clinic hours.  \\\"",\\n  \\\""tavily_search_results\\\"": [\\n    {\\n      \\\""query\\\"": \\\""SUSAN L ROEDER NPI 1487615340 NPPES state board Internal Medicine\\\"",\\n      \\\""results\\\"": [\\n        {\\n          \\\""title\\\"": \\\""State University Of Iowa in Iowa City, IA - Medicare Family Medicine\\\"",\\n          \\\""url\\\"": \\\""https://www.medicarelist.com/primary-care/university-of-iowa-hospitals-clinics-medical-service-plan-iowa-city-ia/\\\"",\\n          \\\""content\\\"": \\\""|  |  |\\\\n --- |\\\\n| Provider Name | Susan L Roeder |\\\\n| Provider Type | Practitioner - Medical Oncology |\\\\n| Provider Identifiers | NPI Number: 1487615340 PECOS PAC ID: 7416021548 Enrollment ID: I20080807000091 |\\\\n\\\\n|  |  |\\\\n --- |\\\\n| Provider Name | Anil A Marian |\\\\n| Provider Type | Practitioner - Anesthesiology |\\\\n| Provider Identifiers | NPI Number: 1760609846 PECOS PAC ID: 1456445824 Enrollment ID: I20080807000169 |\\\"",\\n          \\\""metadata\\\"": {\\n            \\\""score\\\"": 0.8156003\\n          }\\n        },\\n        {\\n          \\\""title\\\"": \\\""Dr. Susan L.

Fax: 319-353-8383.\\n\\nAffiliation / employer / practice location evidence:\\n- University of Iowa Health Care / State University of Iowa appears as primary practice affiliation. Multiple directory pages (US News, Medicarelist, and local provider profiles) list her practicing at University of Iowa Health Care / State University of Iowa (practice NPI referenced on US News: 1477554814), consistent with the 200 Hawkins Dr address (University of Iowa Hospitals & Clinics address).\\n- Additional listed affiliation: Jefferson County Health Center (appears on US News profile as an affiliation as well).\\n\\nLicensure and dates found:\\n- US News lists an Iowa State medical license and states IA State Medical License active through 2027 (this is the only explicit license expiration/active-through date found in the captured pages).\\n- Training dates on US News: Residency Internal Medicine 1993-1996; Fellowship Hematology & Medical Oncology 1996-1998 (background, not licensing). CMS EHR Stage entries (2011-2013) appear on US News profile.\\n\\nSpecialty / department / role:\\n- Specialties listed across sources: Internal Medicine; Medical Oncology (primary taxonomy); Hematology; Hematology & Oncology. Some payer/provider directories list specialty as Adult/Internal Medicine and Hematology/Oncology.\\n- Departmentally, likely within University of Iowa Hospitals & Clinics \u2014 Division/Department of Internal Medicine and/or Hematology/Oncology (no explicit departmental webpage captured in searches that lists department name and schedule).\\n\\nWorking hours / schedule:\\n- No working hours or clinic schedule were found in the captured pages.\\n\\nPhone numbers and addresses (captured):\\n- Practice address: 200 Hawkins Dr, Iowa City, IA 52242-1009 (NPI-derived and matches University of Iowa location).\\n- Practice phone: 319-356-2353.

US News lists the IA license active through 2027, but direct verification on the Iowa Board of Medicine licensure lookup is recommended for the authoritative license status and exact issuance/expiration dates.\\n- No explicit clinic department page with working hours or an official University of Iowa provider profile page (with last-updated timestamp) was captured within the five-search limit; directory pages and aggregated NPI viewers were the primary sources.\\n\\nRecommended next steps (if you want further verification):\\n1) Query the Iowa Board of Medicine license lookup for \\\""Susan L Roeder\\\"" (and former name Roman) to confirm active license details and dates.\\n2) Visit the official University of Iowa Health Care provider directory or departmental Hematology/Oncology faculty/provider pages to confirm departmental affiliation, role/title, and clinic hours.  \"",\n  \""tavily_search_results\"": [\n    {\n      \""query\"": \""SUSAN L ROEDER NPI 1487615340 NPPES state board Internal Medicine\"",\n      \""results\"": [\n        {\n          \""title\"": \""State University Of Iowa in Iowa City, IA - Medicare Family Medicine\"",\n          \""url\"": \""https://www.medicarelist.com/primary-care/university-of-iowa-hospitals-clinics-medical-service-plan-iowa-city-ia/\"",\n          \""content\"": \""|  |  |\\n --- |\\n| Provider Name | Susan L Roeder |\\n| Provider Type | Practitioner - Medical Oncology |\\n| Provider Identifiers | NPI Number: 1487615340 PECOS PAC ID: 7416021548 Enrollment ID: I20080807000091 |\\n\\n|  |  |\\n --- |\\n| Provider Name | Anil A Marian |\\n| Provider Type | Practitioner - Anesthesiology |\\n| Provider Identifiers | NPI Number: 1760609846 PECOS PAC ID: 1456445824 Enrollment ID: I20080807000169 |\"",\n          \""metadata\"": {\n            \""score\"": 0.8156003\n          }\n        },\n        {\n          \""title\"": \""Dr. Susan L.

US News lists the IA license active through 2027, but direct verification on the Iowa Board of Medicine licensure lookup is recommended for the authoritative license status and exact issuance/expiration dates.\\\\n- No explicit clinic department page with working hours or an official University of Iowa provider profile page (with last-updated timestamp) was captured within the five-search limit; directory pages and aggregated NPI viewers were the primary sources.\\\\n\\\\nRecommended next steps (if you want further verification):\\\\n1) Query the Iowa Board of Medicine license lookup for \\\\\\\""Susan L Roeder\\\\\\\"" (and former name Roman) to confirm active license details and dates.\\\\n2) Visit the official University of Iowa Health Care provider directory or departmental Hematology/Oncology faculty/provider pages to confirm departmental affiliation, role/title, and clinic hours.  \\\"",\\n  \\\""tavily_search_results\\\"": [\\n    {\\n      \\\""query\\\"": \\\""SUSAN L ROEDER NPI 1487615340 NPPES state board Internal Medicine\\\"",\\n      \\\""results\\\"": [\\n        {\\n          \\\""title\\\"": \\\""State University Of Iowa in Iowa City, IA - Medicare Family Medicine\\\"",\\n          \\\""url\\\"": \\\""https://www.medicarelist.com/primary-care/university-of-iowa-hospitals-clinics-medical-service-plan-iowa-city-ia/\\\"",\\n          \\\""content\\\"": \\\""|  |  |\\\\n --- |\\\\n| Provider Name | Susan L Roeder |\\\\n| Provider Type | Practitioner - Medical Oncology |\\\\n| Provider Identifiers | NPI Number: 1487615340 PECOS PAC ID: 7416021548 Enrollment ID: I20080807000091 |\\\\n\\\\n|  |  |\\\\n --- |\\\\n| Provider Name | Anil A Marian |\\\\n| Provider Type | Practitioner - Anesthesiology |\\\\n| Provider Identifiers | NPI Number: 1760609846 PECOS PAC ID: 1456445824 Enrollment ID: I20080807000169 |\\\"",\\n          \\\""metadata\\\"": {\\n            \\\""score\\\"": 0.8156003\\n          }\\n        },\\n        {\\n          \\\""title\\\"": \\\""Dr. Susan L.

Additional taxonomies listed: 207R00000X Internal Medicine; 207RH0000X Hematology; 207RH0003X Hematology & Oncology.\\\\n- Mailing / Practice address on NPI-derived record(s): 200 HAWKINS DR, IOWA CITY, IA 52242-1009, USA.\\\\n- Practice phone (from NPI-derived record): 319-356-2353. Fax: 319-353-8383.\\\\n\\\\nAffiliation / employer / practice location evidence:\\\\n- University of Iowa Health Care / State University of Iowa appears as primary practice affiliation. Multiple directory pages (US News, Medicarelist, and local provider profiles) list her practicing at University of Iowa Health Care / State University of Iowa (practice NPI referenced on US News: 1477554814), consistent with the 200 Hawkins Dr address (University of Iowa Hospitals & Clinics address).\\\\n- Additional listed affiliation: Jefferson County Health Center (appears on US News profile as an affiliation as well).\\\\n\\\\nLicensure and dates found:\\\\n- US News lists an Iowa State medical license and states IA State Medical License active through 2027 (this is the only explicit license expiration/active-through date found in the captured pages).\\\\n- Training dates on US News: Residency Internal Medicine 1993-1996; Fellowship Hematology & Medical Oncology 1996-1998 (background, not licensing). CMS EHR Stage entries (2011-2013) appear on US News profile.\\\\n\\\\nSpecialty / department / role:\\\\n- Specialties listed across sources: Internal Medicine; Medical Oncology (primary taxonomy); Hematology; Hematology & Oncology. Some payer/provider directories list specialty as Adult/Internal Medicine and Hematology/Oncology.\\\\n- Departmentally, likely within University of Iowa Hospitals & Clinics \\u2014 Division/Department of Internal Medicine and/or Hematology/Oncology (no explicit departmental webpage captured in searches that lists department name and schedule).\\\\n\\\\nWorking hours / schedule:\\\\n- No working hours or clinic schedule were found in the captured pages.\\\\n\\\\nPhone numbers and addresses (captured):\\\\n- Practice address: 200 Hawkins Dr, Iowa City, IA 52242-1009 (NPI-derived and matches University of Iowa location).\\\\n- Practice phone: 319-356-2353. Fax: 319-353-8383.\\\\n\\\\nEvidence that information is current / provenance:\\\\n- NPI record (NPPES-derived viewers) listing NPI 1487615340 with current practice address and taxonomies \\u2014 authoritative for NPI-linked practice information.\\\\n- US News profile repeats NPI and lists IA license active through 2027 (provides an explicit license active-through date).\\\\n- Health Alliance / Medicarelist provider pages corroborate NPI and affiliation (University of Iowa / State University of Iowa) and specialties.\\\\n\\\\nNotes and limitations:\\\\n- I reached the maximum allowed Tavily search calls for this task; I did not query the Iowa Board of Medicine site directly (which would be the authoritative state board source) within these searches. US News lists the IA license active through 2027, but direct verification on the Iowa Board of Medicine licensure lookup is recommended for the authoritative license status and exact issuance/expiration dates.\\\\n- No explicit clinic department page with working hours or an official University of Iowa provider profile page (with last-updated timestamp) was captured within the five-search limit; directory pages and aggregated NPI viewers were the primary sources.\\\\n\\\\nRecommended next steps (if you want further verification):\\\\n1) Query the Iowa Board of Medicine license lookup for \\\\\\\""Susan L Roeder\\\\\\\"" (and former name Roman) to confirm active license details and dates.\\\\n2) Visit the official University of Iowa Health Care provider directory or departmental Hematology/Oncology faculty/provider pages to confirm departmental affiliation, role/title, and clinic hours.  \\\"",\\n  \\\""tavily_search_results\\\"": [\\n    {\\n      \\\""query\\\"": \\\""SUSAN L ROEDER NPI 1487615340 NPPES state board Internal Medicine\\\"",\\n      \\\""results\\\"": [\\n        {\\n          \\\""title\\\"": \\\""State University Of Iowa in Iowa City, IA - Medicare Family Medicine\\\"",\\n          \\\""url\\\"": \\\""https://www.medicarelist.com/primary-care/university-of-iowa-hospitals-clinics-medical-service-plan-iowa-city-ia/\\\"",\\n          \\\""content\\\"": \\\""|  |  |\\\\n --- |\\\\n| Provider Name | Susan L Roeder |\\\\n| Provider Type | Practitioner - Medical Oncology |\\\\n| Provider Identifiers | NPI Number: 1487615340 PECOS PAC ID: 7416021548 Enrollment ID: I20080807000091 |\\\\n\\\\n|  |  |\\\\n --- |\\\\n| Provider Name | Anil A Marian |\\\\n| Provider Type | Practitioner - Anesthesiology |\\\\n| Provider Identifiers | NPI Number: 1760609846 PECOS PAC ID: 1456445824 Enrollment ID: I20080807000169 |\\\"",\\n          \\\""metadata\\\"": {\\n            \\\""score\\\"": 0.8156003\\n          }\\n        },\\n        {\\n          \\\""title\\\"": \\\""Dr. Susan L.

  ""final_decision"": ""Chose web result"",
  ""evaluation_info"": ""5.1 AFFILIATION SELECTION REASONING\n\nStep 1: Primary Affiliation Identification (Private Practice Priority)\n- I seeded identity with NPI 1669479853 (NPPES) which lists MARK DAVID LOGSDON M.D., taxonomy Radiation Oncology Physician (2085R0001X), practice location 2825 Capitol Ave Ste 502, Sacramento, CA. That established geography and specialty.\n- Although the input PRIMARY_AFFILIATION_NAME is \""SUTTER VALLEY MEDICAL FOUNDATION,\"" web sources (Sutter Health provider profile and related listings) show Dr. Logsdon practicing at a Sutter-affiliated clinic (Sutter Medical Group / Sutter Medical Plaza) at the same Capitol Ave address. This is consistent with the NPI practice location.\n\nStep 2: Web-Chosen vs Primary Affiliation Analysis\n- Recency: NPPES last updated 2018-07-23 for the NPI record; the Sutter Health provider profile appears active (no explicit page-level date found). Multiple current provider directories (Sutter Health, Marshall Medical, Doximity) list the same address and phone, indicating the clinician is presently associated with Sutter-affiliated services. No explicit \""last updated\"" on the Sutter profile, so I recorded \""No date found\"" for the affiliation page.\n- Authority: Sutter Health site is Tier 1 (official hospital/clinic website). NPPES is authoritative for NPI record. Marshall Medical (health system site) and Doximity corroborate contact details.\n- Consistency: Address (2825 Capitol Ave Ste 502), phone (916-454-6600), specialty (Radiation Oncology) match across multiple sources.\n- Specificity: The Sutter provider profile shows physician-specific listing; Marshall Medical page also lists same clinic and contact details.\n\nStep 3: Conflict Resolution\n- The NPI-table affiliation provided (SUTTER VALLEY MEDICAL FOUNDATION) and web-found affiliation (Sutter Medical Group / Sutter Health at Capitol Ave) are not contradictory; Sutter Valley Medical Foundation is a Sutter-affiliated entity and the web evidence shows active practice within the Sutter network. Because web sources are current and authoritative and the NPPES record is older, I selected the web result (Sutter Medical Group/Sutter Health at 2825 Capitol Ave) as the primary affiliation for contact/address extraction.\n\n5.2 PHONE NUMBER VALIDATION MATRIX\n- Types checked: Primary office/scheduling number (916-454-6600) appears as the clinic/main number on NPPES-derived records, Doximity, Marshall Medical, and Sutter page. No direct personal line or extension was found publicly.\n- Format: Normalized to 916-454-6600.\n- Area code matches Sacramento, CA.\n- Cross-reference: same number appears on multiple authoritative sources (NPPES-derived XML/records, Sutter Health listing, Marshall Medical group page).\n- Conclusion: 916-454-6600 is the most accurate clinic/scheduling number for the selected clinic address. No provider direct line or extension publicly shown, so the clinic main line was chosen per hierarchy.\n\n5.3 ADDRESS VALIDATION PROTOCOL\n- Address components found and standardized from NPPES-derived sources and Sutter/Marshall pages: 2825 Capitol Ave, Ste 502, Sacramento, CA 95816.\n- Suite recorded as address_2: Ste 502.\n- Verified consistency across NPPES records, Marshall Medical listing, Doximity and Sutter provider page.\n- No conflicting alternate primary address found for this clinician in the searches performed.\n\n5.4 SOURCE URL HIERARCHY\n- Tier 1 sources used: Sutter Health provider profile (selected_affiliation_source_url), NPPES provider-view (npiregistry.cms.hhs.gov provider page), Marshall Medical group provider page.\n- Tier 2 used for corroboration: Doximity and other provider directories.\n- Tier 3 not used as primary evidence except for corroboration where necessary.\n\n5.5 CONFLICT RESOLUTION FRAMEWORK\n- Where differences could exist between the NPI-table affiliation name and web-found affiliation, I examined recency and authority. NPPES record is older (2018) while Sutter profile and health system listings are current and authoritative for contacting patients. Because the Sutter listing is the active booking/clinic listing at the same address and phone, I selected it as the primary web result. Any minor naming differences (Sutter Valley Medical Foundation vs Sutter Medical Group / Sutter Health) are within the same health system; I prioritized the direct clinic/hospital site for address/phone extraction.\n\n5.6 CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT\nOverall Confidence: High\n- Rationale: Multiple Tier-1/Tier-2 authoritative sources (Sutter Health provider page, NPPES registry, Marshall Medical provider page, Doximity) consistently report the same street address and clinic phone number. Name (including middle name/initial), specialty (Radiation Oncology), city/state (Sacramento, CA) and phone all match. The only minor gap is lack of an explicit \""last updated\"" date on the Sutter profile page; however the consistency across authoritative sources supports high confidence in correctness of the selected affiliation, address, and phone.\n\nNote on NPI-table affiliation: The input PRIMARY_AFFILIATION_NAME \""SUTTER VALLEY MEDICAL FOUNDATION\"" is a Sutter-affiliated entity and not materially different for patient contact from the web-found Sutter Medical Group / Sutter Medical Plaza clinic. I selected the Sutter web clinic listing as the best single site for address and phone extraction.\n\nAll of the above steps, heuristics, and the source hierarchy were applied in selection and validation."",

  ""evaluation_info"": ""AFFILIATION SELECTION REASONING\n\nStep 0 - Tooling and seed: I started with the NPI as the anchor to seed identity and practice location. I used Tavily for all lookups and tracked queries used.\n\nStep 1 - Identity seeding and disambiguation:\n- Queried the NPI (1992948152) to pull NPPES-like info (search: \""NPI 1992948152 NPPES\""). Result sources (HIPAASpace extract of NPPES data) listed practice location 5841 S Maryland Ave, Chicago IL 60637 and a phone of 888-824-0200 (system appointments). This anchored the provider to University of Chicago Medicine (Hyde Park).\n- Confirmed provider name as Ardaman Shergill on University of Chicago Medicine site and University directory. Directory includes phone, mail code, and affiliation lines showing Assistant Professor of Medicine; Department: Medicine, Hematology/Oncology. No conflicting name variants found. NPI-derived geography (Chicago, IL) aligns.\n- Checked state medical board was not necessary beyond alignment because multiple authoritative University pages confirm active faculty/clinical appointment; no contradictory licensing/name issues were found.\n\nStep 2 - Candidate affiliation discovery:\n- Priority sources located: UChicago Medicine physician profile (Find-a-Physician page), University of Chicago directory, and Biological Sciences Division faculty page. These are Tier 1 (official hospital/clinic and academic) and list Dr. Shergill.\n- Candidate organizations collected: UChicago Medicine / The University of Chicago Medical Center (physician profile), University of Chicago Biological Sciences Division (faculty page).\n\nStep 3 - Select a single top affiliation (scoring and tie-breakers):\n- Evidence priority: Official UChicago Medicine physician profile page lists the provider, appointment request link, and location; University directory lists direct phone and mail code. Both are authoritative and consistent. These satisfy priorities (hospital/health system + academic appointment with direct clinic listing).\n- Recency: No explicit page-level \""last updated\"" timestamp found on the profile pages returned. However, multiple active appointment/scheduling signals and current departmental listings indicate an active, current affiliation.\n- Tie-breaker: UChicago Medicine physician profile is the official clinical profile (bookable/appointment link and system appointment number). University directory provides a narrower phone line and departmental address. Combined, they form consistent evidence.\n- Selected top affiliation: UChicago Medicine (The University of Chicago Medical Center) — this matches the NPI table PRIMARY_AFFILIATION_NAME.\n\nStep 4 - Retrieve address for the top affiliation only:\n- Primary source: UChicago Medicine physician profile lists location as 5841 S. Maryland Avenue, Chicago, IL 60637. The University directory lists address as 5841 S. Maryland, MC 2115, Chicago, IL 60637. NPPES-derived entry shows 5841 S MARYLAND AVE CHICAGO IL 60637-1443. I selected the clinic address as shown on the physician profile and included MC 2115 as address_2 (mail code) from the directory.\n- Normalized street and components to USPS-style; used 2-letter state code IL and 5-digit ZIP 60637 (NPPES also shows a 9-digit variant 60637-1443; official profile shows 60637 so 5-digit used).\n\nStep 5 - Retrieve the most accurate phone for that exact clinic address:\n- Sources: UChicago Medicine physician profile shows \""Appointments: 1-888-824-0200\"" (system scheduling). University directory (official campus directory) lists a direct phone (773-702-4274) and fax (773-702-3163). UChicago main switchboard 773-702-1000 is also present on site pages.\n- Preference applied: direct clinic/department line (773-702-4274) chosen over the general appointment line because it appears on the official university directory as Dr. Shergill's office contact. System appointment line is noted as alternate.\n\nStep 6 - Date extraction:\n- No explicit \""Last updated\"" or published/modified dates were found on the UChicago Medicine profile, University directory, or Biological Sciences faculty page. Therefore, set selected_affiliation_date to \""No date found\"".\n\nStep 7 - Validation, normalization, quality checks:\n- NAME: Verified exact name match to input (ARDAMAN SHERGILL); no middle name present online — passes.\n- SPECIALTY: Verified Hematology/Oncology / Medical Oncology on multiple UChicago pages; aligns with clinical expectations.\n- ADDRESS: Contains street, city, 2-letter state (IL), and ZIP 60637; matches NPPES; MC 2115 included as secondary address component.\n- PHONE: Normalized to 10-digit US format (773-702-4274). Cross-checked against UChicago directory and physician profile (which uses system appointment line). NPPES phone (as surfaced in secondary source) shows 888-824-0200 (appointments); used as corroboration for system scheduling but not selected as primary direct contact.\n- Cross-verification: Address and phone confirmed across at least two independent official sources (UChicago Medicine physician profile + University directory + NPPES record for the address). No major conflicts.\n\nStep 8 - Validation against NPI table (PRIMARY_AFFILIATION_NAME):\n- The PRIMARY_AFFILIATION_NAME provided (THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO MEDICAL CENTER) aligns with the web-found affiliation (UChicago Medicine / The University of Chicago Medical Center). Because they match, and web evidence is authoritative, the final decision is to retain the NPI table affiliation.\n\nStep 9 - Loop control and stopping conditions:\n- Stopped after finding a qualified top affiliation with validated address and phone. Total Tavily queries used: 3. recursion_limit_reached set to false.\n\nStep 10 - Contradictions and reasoning:\n- Minor differences: NPPES-derived phone sometimes shows the central appointment line (888-824-0200) while directory shows a direct clinic line (773-702-4274). I preferred direct clinic line for reachability. ZIP has 9-digit form in one data source (60637-1443) but official profile and directory use 60637; I used the standard 5-digit ZIP 60637 and included MC 2115 as secondary address.\n- All decisions prioritize official university/health system pages; third-party directory data was used only for corroboration.\n\nPHONE NUMBER VALIDATION MATRIX (summary):\n- Phone types checked: system appointment (1-888-824-0200), main hospital (773-702-1000), direct office (773-702-4274), fax (773-702-3163). Selected 773-702-4274 as the most direct office line tied to the directory and faculty listing. Formatting normalized to 773-702-4274.\n\nADDRESS VALIDATION PROTOCOL (summary):\n- Street: 5841 S. Maryland Ave (confirmed on UChicago pages). Suite/mail code: MC 2115 taken from university directory. City/State/Zip confirmed and consistent with NPPES.\n\nSOURCE URL HIERARCHY used (summary):\n- Tier 1: UChicago Medicine physician profile (used as primary clinical profile), University of Chicago directory (direct contact and departmental mailing info), Biological Sciences faculty page.\n- Tier 2/3: NPPES-derived data via HIPAA-space listing used to corroborate practice location and system appointment number.\n\nCONFLICT RESOLUTION FRAMEWORK (applied):\n- Date missing across pages -> used multiple official sources and recency signals (active appointment booking links, departmental listings) to assert current affiliation.\n- For conflicting phone numbers, prioritized direct office line on official university directory over system appointment number for clinician-level contact.\n\nConfidence assessment: see confidence_level_assessment field below.\n\nSOURCES and NOTES: Official UChicago Medicine physician profile, University of Chicago directory entry for Ardaman Shergill, Biological Sciences Division faculty page referencing clinical interests and role, and NPPES-derived listing (seen via HIPAASpace search result) for practice address and appointment number. No explicit page update/publish date found on primary profile pages.\n"",
