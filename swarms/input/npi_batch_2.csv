Alternate third-party numbers (examples: (484) 381-0241 / (484) 381-0254 shown on aggregator pages; various Healthgrades entries with different local numbers) were deprioritized because they are third-party listings without direct Jefferson Health corroboration and because there is an address discrepancy across sources (input and many directories list 3491 Commerce Ave while Jefferson's official site shows 3941 Commerce Ave). Due to that address mismatch between third-party aggregators and Jefferson Health, the Jefferson first-party clinic line/address were selected as primary despite the conflicting 3491 address in the original candidate data.

  ""final_decision"": ""Chose web result"",
  ""evaluation_info"": ""AFFILIATION SELECTION REASONING:\n\nStep 0 — Identity seeding and disambiguation\n- Seeded search with NPI 1780889139. Pulled the NPPES registry entry showing QIWEI W. GAI MD, practice location 291 Stoner Ave, Westminster, MD 21157-5647 and phone 410-871-6400 (NPPES view and mirror sites). NPI status: Active; enumeration date 2007-06-17; last NPPES update noted on mirror pages (e.g., HipaaSpace) 2021-10-11.\n- Confirmed name variants online (Qiwei Gai; Qiwei William Gai) and presence of middle initial W in registry; specialty listed as Hematology / Medical Oncology across directories.\n\nStep 1 — Candidate affiliation discovery\n- Candidate organizations discovered: Carroll Medical Oncology / William E. Kahlert Regional Cancer Center (address 291 Stoner Ave, Westminster), Carroll Hospital Center (200 Memorial Ave, Westminster), Sinai Hospital of Baltimore (listed as affiliated hospital in directories), LifeBridge Health system pages referencing Carroll and Sinai affiliations.\n- Sources used: NPPES provider view, LifeBridge Health cancer services page, Healthgrades provider and group pages, MedicalNewsToday/Connect and other provider directories.\n\nStep 2 — Scoring and selection rationale\n- Evidence priority: The NPPES practice location is physically at 291 Stoner Ave, Westminster; multiple independent directories (Healthgrades, Sharecare, Medical News Today Connect) list the provider at 291 Stoner Ave and associate that location with the regional cancer center/Carroll Hospital oncology services.\n- The provider is listed as affiliated with Sinai Hospital of Baltimore on several directories; however Sinai’s main campus is in Baltimore (Belvedere Ave) while the provider’s practice location and clinic-level presence (bookable clinic/oncology center) are in Westminster at 291 Stoner Ave — this indicates the provider’s primary practice site is the Carroll cancer center/clinic in Westminster.\n- Priority rule: prefer the physician’s clinic-level bookable location (Carroll Medical Oncology / William E. Kahlert Regional Cancer Center) over a broader hospital-affiliation listing (Sinai Hospital) when clinic address/phone and NPI location indicate the clinician practices at the Carroll site.\n\nStep 3 — Conflict resolution\n- Directories list both Carroll Hospital Center and Sinai Hospital as affiliated hospitals. LifeBridge Health operates multiple hospitals (including Sinai and Carroll). Because the NPI practice location and clinic-level listings point to 291 Stoner Ave (Westminster) and multiple directories show the clinic phone 410-871-6400 tied to that address, I prioritized the Carroll oncology clinic as the primary affiliation for in-person patient access.\n- No authoritative clinic profile page with an explicit “last updated” date was found; therefore I could not apply a recency multiplier based on page timestamps. I used NPPES, LifeBridge Health content, and major provider directories for cross-confirmation.\n\nPHONE NUMBER VALIDATION MATRIX:\n- Phone candidate: 410-871-6400\n- Appears in NPPES mirror pages and multiple provider directories as the contact number for the clinic at 291 Stoner Ave. Matches Westminster area code and NPPES phone field.\n- No dedicated individual direct extension or provider-specific direct line was found in official pages searched; the number appears to be the clinic/location scheduling/main line. Cross-referenced on Healthgrades and Medical News Today provider profiles and LifeBridge content listing clinic addresses.\n- Conclusion: selected clinic scheduling/main clinic number 410-871-6400 as best available and most accurate for the 291 Stoner Ave location.\n\nADDRESS VALIDATION PROTOCOL:\n- Address components assembled from NPPES and provider directories: 291 Stoner Ave, Westminster, MD 21157-5647.\n- Verified across at least two independent sources (NPPES mirror page / hipaaspace and provider directories such as Healthgrades / Medical News Today). LifeBridge Health site lists Carroll Medical Oncology / Carroll Medical Oncology reference for 291 Stoner Ave in their cancer services listing.\n- ZIP+4 pulled from NPPES mirrored record (21157-5647). If needed for USPS standardization, the 5-digit base is 21157.\n\nSOURCE URL HIERARCHY and SOURCES USED:\n- Tier 1 priority used: NPPES (provider registry) and LifeBridge Health (system site) which lists cancer services and clinic locations. Where available, clinic/hospital pages and group pages were preferred over tertiary directories.\n- Secondary corroboration from Healthgrades, Medical News Today / Connect, Sharecare, HipaaSpace NPI mirror.\n- Source URLs used (representative):\n  * https://npiregistry.cms.hhs.gov/provider-view/1780889139\n  * https://www.hipaaspace.com/medical_billing/coding/national_provider_identifier/codes/npi_1780889139.aspx\n  * https://www.lifebridgehealth.org/services/cancer-care\n  * https://www.healthgrades.com/physician/dr-qiwei-gai-gh5h5\n  * https://connect.medicalnewstoday.com/provider/dr-qiwei-gai-1780889139\n  * https://www.healthgrades.com/group-directory/md-maryland/westminster/william-e-kahlert-regional-cancer-center-carroll-hospital-center-xx4ptf\n\nCONFLICT RESOLUTION FRAMEWORK APPLIED:\n- When sources disagreed on the high-level affiliation (Sinai Hospital vs Carroll Hospital Center), I applied the following:\n  1. NPPES practice location and phone (clinic-level) as primary anchor.\n  2. Prefer clinic-level listing where the physician is bookable/has a listed clinic address.\n  3. Validate across multiple independent directories.\n  4. If no clinic-level number existed, would fallback to hospital switchboard, but here clinic number 410-871-6400 is available and consistent.\n\nCONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT:\n- Overall Confidence: Medium\n- Confidence reasoning: Multiple independent and authoritative sources (NPPES, LifeBridge Health listing, Healthgrades, Medical News Today) consistently show Qiwei W. Gai MD practicing in Westminster with specialty Hematology/Medical Oncology and the clinic address 291 Stoner Ave with phone 410-871-6400. However, an explicit dated clinic profile page with a visible \""last updated\"" timestamp was not located; several directory pages are undated. Also the NPI-table affiliation provided (SINAI HOSPITAL OF BALTIMORE) appears as an affiliated hospital on multiple directories, but clinic-level evidence points to Carroll Hospital Center / William E. Kahlert Regional Cancer Center at 291 Stoner Ave as the provider’s primary practice site. Because of the lack of a page-level update date and the directory-based nature of some corroborating sources, I assign Medium confidence.\n\nNOTES & LIMITATIONS:\n- No explicit \""last updated\"" or published date found on the selected clinic/source page; selected_affiliation_date set to \""No date found\"".\n- Multiple directories list Sinai Hospital of Baltimore as an affiliated hospital for the physician; LifeBridge Health operates both Sinai (Baltimore) and Carroll (Westminster). The clinic-level practice location (291 Stoner Ave) and clinic phone point to Carroll Medical Oncology/William E. Kahlert Regional Cancer Center as the physician’s practical primary site.\n- If a higher-confidence outcome is required, recommend direct confirmation (phone call to 410-871-6400 or querying Carroll Hospital Center / William E. Kahlert Regional Cancer Center scheduling) or request access to PECOS/Medicare Care Compare clinician profile for a dated affiliation entry.\n\nAll steps and reasoning above follow the search, validation, tie-breaking, and conflict resolution rules provided. The selected affiliation is the clinic-level location where the physician is listed as practicing and which matches the NPI practice address and phone."",
