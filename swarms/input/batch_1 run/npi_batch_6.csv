  ""final_decision"": ""Retained NPI table affiliation"",
  ""evaluation_info"": ""AFFILIATION SELECTION REASONING:\n\nStep 1: Identity seeding and disambiguation\n- Used NPI 1437272010 as anchor. NPPES/org record (provider-view for org NPI 1366197956) shows RAMESH MOOLANI, MD INC with DBA CARE ONCOLOGY CENTER at 855 Third Ave Ste 3330, Chula Vista, CA 91911-1350 and phone 619-745-1031. Sharp HealthCare and Scripps profiles list the same physician and specialty. State license CA found via NPPES snippet. Name (Ramesh K. Moolani / Ramesh Kumar Moolani) and NPI were consistent across sources.\n\nStep 2: Candidate affiliation discovery\n- Found candidate organizations/URLs: NPPES provider-view (org NPI 1366197956), Care Oncology (careonc.com / careonc.com/physicians), Sharp HealthCare doctor profile, Scripps physician profile, NPINO NPI extract.\n- Collected these candidate names/URLs for scoring.\n\nStep 3: Select a single top affiliation\n- Applying priority rules: private practice/clinic prioritized. Evidence shows RAMESH MOOLANI MD INC operates Care Oncology Center (DBA) at the clinic address and phone; clinic appears bookable/contactable and is listed as organization in NPPES.\n- Multiple authoritative sources (NPPES provider-view, Care Oncology site and clinic pages, Sharp provider profile) all show same primary clinic address and phone and specialty. Therefore selected affiliation: RAMESH MOOLANI MD INC (DBA CARE ONCOLOGY CENTER) at 855 Third Ave Ste 3330, Chula Vista, CA 91911-1350.\n\nStep 4: Retrieve address\n- Primary address obtained from NPPES provider-view and corroborated on Care Oncology clinic pages: street, suite, city, state (CA), ZIP 91911-1350.\n\nStep 5: Retrieve phone\n- Clinic line 619-745-1031 present on NPPES org record and Care Oncology website; treated as primary clinic/scheduling number. No more direct personal line found; this clinic number is used for appointments.\n\nStep 6: Date extraction\n- NPPES provider-view (org record) shows Last Updated: 2022-03-09. Care Oncology site did not display an explicit profile-modified date. Selected affiliation date taken from NPPES org record: 2022-03-09.\n\nStep 7: Validation, normalization, quality checks\n- NAME: Matches provider input including middle name/initial. PASS.\n- SPECIALTY: Hematology & Oncology present on multiple authoritative sources. PASS.\n- ADDRESS: Full USPS-style components present and match across NPPES and clinic pages. PASS.\n- PHONE: Normalized to 619-745-1031; appears on authoritative sources. PASS.\n- Cross-verification: Address and phone verified across at least two independent authoritative sources (NPPES and Care Oncology site; Sharp profile corroborates physician affiliation).\n\nStep 8: Validation against NPI table (PRIMARY_AFFILIATION_NAME)\n- Input PRIMARY_AFFILIATION_NAME is 'RAMESH MOOLANI MD INC'. Web-found affiliation is the same legal entity (with DBA CARE ONCOLOGY CENTER). Therefore retained the NPI-table affiliation as primary.\n\nStep 9: Loop control / stopping\n- Stopped after 4 targeted Tavily queries since all validation checks satisfied for a single top affiliation. recursion_limit_reached set to false.\n\nStep 10: Contradictions and reasoning\n- No substantive contradictions. Hospital/system profiles (Sharp, Scripps) list hospital affiliations but the physician’s primary, bookable clinic and organizational NPI are with RAMESH MOOLANI MD INC / CARE ONCOLOGY CENTER. Preferred clinic/DBA because private practice priority rule applied. If future evidence shows a change or more recent update, re-evaluate.\n\nPHONE NUMBER VALIDATION MATRIX:\n- Phone types checked: primary office/scheduling lines. Found clinic scheduling/office line 619-745-1031 on NPPES and clinic website. No personal direct line or extension discovered. Number format normalized to 619-745-1031. Area code (619) matches Chula Vista / San Diego County. Cross-referenced on NPPES and Care Oncology pages.\n\nADDRESS VALIDATION PROTOCOL:\n- Verified street address, suite (Ste 3330), city (Chula Vista), state (CA), ZIP (91911-1350). Confirmed via NPPES provider-view and Care Oncology clinic pages. Address standardized to USPS-style components in output.\n\nSOURCE URL HIERARCHY / SOURCES USED:\n- Tier 1: NPPES provider-view (https://npiregistry.cms.hhs.gov/provider-view/1366197956) — authoritative org/provider record, contains address/phone and Last Updated date.\n- Tier 1/2: Care Oncology clinic pages (careonc.com / careonc.com/physicians) — practice website listing the physician, address, phone.\n- Tier 1/2: Sharp HealthCare physician profile (sharp.com/doctors/ramesh-moolani) — corroborates physician identity, NPI and hospital affiliation.\n- Tertiary: NPINO NPI extract page.\n\nCONFLICT RESOLUTION FRAMEWORK:\n- No conflicts required resolution beyond prioritizing private practice clinic/DBA over hospital listing for primary affiliation. Used most authoritative recent source available (NPPES) and confirmed with clinic website and health system pages.\n\nCONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT:\nOverall Confidence: High\nConfidence Reasoning: Multiple Tier 1 authoritative sources (NPPES provider-view and the clinic's own website) list the identical organization name, address and phone. Sharp HealthCare and Scripps pages corroborate the physician identity and specialty. Name matches exactly including middle initial/name. Address and phone cross-verified. Although the NPPES 'Last Updated' date is 2022-03-09 (older than 12 months), there is no evidence of a move or change; the same contact details are present on the Care Oncology site and health system pages. Therefore confidence is High."",
