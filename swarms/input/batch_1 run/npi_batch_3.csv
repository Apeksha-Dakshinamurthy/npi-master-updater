  ""final_decision"": ""Chose web result"",
  ""evaluation_info"": ""AFFILIATION SELECTION REASONING\n\nStep 1 — Identity seeding: NPI 1639481856 maps (via NPPES-surfaced copies) to Kelly J. Wilkinson, M.D., practice location 2500 N State St, Jackson, MS. Web searches show an authoritative University of Mississippi Medical Center (UMMC) faculty/provider profile for Kelly J. (Jeanes) Wilkinson, MD in the Department of Medicine, Hematology & Oncology. The provider name (including middle initial/name), specialty, and Jackson, MS geography align.\n\nStep 2 — Candidate discovery (sources collected): UMMC faculty page (Faculty/Wilkinson_Kelly_J), UMMC provider profile (Provider/Wilkinson_Kelly_Jeanes), UMMC Hematology & Oncology faculty listing, and NPI registry / NPPES-derived mirror (HIPAASpace / NPI data sites). These were prioritized in that order (official clinic/university profile first, NPPES as corroboration).\n\nStep 3 — Selection and tie-breakers: The UMMC faculty/provider pages are official institutional profiles showing active roles (associate professor, clinic-oriented responsibilities, recent activity items from 2023–2024). This met the evidence priority (official hospital/health-system profile with scheduling/contact info). No evidence was found that AccentCare Home Health of Jackson is the provider's primary clinical affiliation; that organization was the input NPI-table affiliation, but web evidence shows active UMMC affiliation with more recent content. Therefore web result chosen.\n\nStep 4 — Address retrieval: UMMC pages reference 2500 North State Street, Jackson, MS 39216. NPPES-representations show 2500 N State St, Department of Medicine, Jackson, MS 39216-4500; the Department is treated as address_2. Full address normalized to USPS-style components.\n\nStep 5 — Phone retrieval: The UMMC faculty page lists Work Phone (601) 984-5590 — selected as the clinic-level contact. NPPES-derived sources list 601-984-5601; UMMC official site prioritized per rules. Also noted general UMMC lines: main 601-984-1000 and patient appointments 888-815-2005 in source pages. Preference given to the physician/faculty 'Work Phone' on official UMMC page.\n\nStep 6 — Date extraction: No explicit page-level 'Last updated' or 'Modified' timestamp was found on the UMMC profile page (returned content includes dated activity items up to 2024 but no single page metadata date). Per rule, set to 'No date found'. Content recency (2023–2024 activity entries) suggests recent maintenance of the profile.\n\nStep 7 — Validation & quality checks: Name matches exactly (Kelly J. Wilkinson / Kelly Jeanes Wilkinson). Specialty on web aligns (Hematology/Oncology). Address includes street, city, 2-letter state, ZIP+4. Phone normalized and taken from UMMC official faculty/profile page. Cross-confirmation present between UMMC pages and NPPES-derived data for address; phone shows minor conflict which is noted.\n\nStep 8 — Validation against NPI table input: PRIMARY_AFFILIATION_NAME from input was 'ACCENTCARE HOME HEALTH OF JACKSON'. Web evidence indicates active institutional affiliation with University of Mississippi Medical Center, which appears more authoritative and more recently updated. Under tie-breaker rules and recency/authority criteria, web result was selected.\n\nStep 9 — Loop control: Stopped after 5 Tavily queries (hard stop). Satisfied selection criteria (official profile, validated address and phone). recursion_limit_reached = true.\n\nStep 10 — Contradictions & resolution: Phone number discrepancy: UMMC faculty page lists 601-984-5590; NPPES-derived record lists 601-984-5601. Resolution: prefer UMMC faculty/profile 'Work Phone' as authoritative; included notes in validation_summary. If downstream systems require alternate lines, NPPES number and UMMC central numbers are recorded in source URLs/notes.\n\nSOURCE/PRIORITY NOTES: Official UMMC faculty/provider pages (Tier 1) were used as primary sources. NPPES/NPI mirror sites and tertiary directories were used only for corroboration. No private-practice profile or independent clinic was found that supersedes UMMC as primary.\n\nPHONE NUMBER VALIDATION MATRIX: Preferred hierarchy applied — chosen phone from official faculty profile (clinic/work phone). Alternate numbers (NPPES phone, patient appt line, main switchboard) noted as backups. Area code (601) matches Jackson, MS.\n\nADDRESS VALIDATION PROTOCOL: USPS-style normalization applied. Address cross-confirmed on UMMC profile and NPPES-derived records. Geographical match to NPPES practice city/state verified.\n\nSOURCE URL HIERARCHY & CONFLICT RESOLUTION: Official institutional pages (UMMC) > NPPES mirrors > tertiary directories. When conflicting data (phone) exists, used most authoritative official page and documented conflict.\n\nCONFIDENCE: See confidence_level_assessment entry.\n"",

Multiple independent authoritative sources (UMMC pages + NPPES record) corroborate the affiliation; web content shows activity in 2023–2024 indicating recency. Therefore overall confidence = High.""
