Next verification steps: (1) check Vanderbilt Health provider/location pages for The Vanderbilt Clinic to find a clinic front-desk or appointments line on the org site, (2) confirm NPPES registry entry for NPI 1770711657 for address/phone/date, (3) if found, update primary/secondary phone sources to first-party Vanderbilt Health pages and raise confidence to high.\n\nValidation issues to fix:\n- selector_confidence_score is set to 'high' while the selected phone/address sources are only third-party NPI-mirror pages. Per the validation rules, if first-party (Vanderbilt Health or official NPPES page) evidence is not present, selector_confidence_score should be 'medium' or 'low', or you must provide explicit first-party evidence (org site or NPPES) to justify 'high'.\n- The output contains extra top-level fields not in the required schema (for example: 'selector_supervisor_output' and nested 'original_input'). Remove any non-schema fields from the final output so the JSON strictly matches the expected schema.\n- The selection_reason/phone_address_selection_reasons should explicitly state that a search for first-party Vanderbilt Health/provider pages was performed and summarize the result (e.g., 'searched vanderbilthealth.com \u2014 no clinic-level phone found' or 'clinic page found at [URL]').
