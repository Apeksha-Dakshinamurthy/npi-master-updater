  ""recursion_limit_reached"": true,
  ""final_decision"": ""Retained NPI table affiliation"",
  ""evaluation_info"": ""AFFILIATION SELECTION REASONING:\n\nStep 1 - Identity seeding and disambiguation:\n- Anchored on NPI 1083703383. NPI sources (NPPES-derived aggregators) show: SAIAMA NAHEED WAQAR MD, taxonomy Medical Oncology (207RX0202X), practice state MO, practice location listed as 4921 Parkview Pl Ste 7A/7B/7C, Saint Louis, MO 63110-1032. WashU faculty pages list provider as 'Saiama N. Waqar, MD, MSCI' (middle initial N matches NAHEED). PECOS/clinician utilization pages also tie NPI to Washington University / Siteman Cancer Center. Identity is consistent across NPI, PECOS and WashU.\n\nStep 2 - Candidate affiliation discovery:\n- Priority sources discovered: Washington University School of Medicine Division of Oncology (official faculty/profile pages), Siteman Cancer Center/Center for Advanced Medicine location pages, find-a-doctor / BJC provider directories, NPI aggregator pages (NPPES-derived). All point to Washington University / Siteman Cancer Center as primary practice.\n\nStep 3 - Select top affiliation (scoring & tie-breakers):\n- Evidence priority rules applied: official university/hospital profile with clinic location and patient scheduling signals took precedence. WashU oncology profile + system location pages + NPPES practice location all align. There is a department mail stop (660 S Euclid Ave) on the faculty page, but the patient-facing clinic location is Center for Advanced Medicine (4921 Parkview Pl). Given the provider is clinically active (accepting patients, clinic program listed), the clinic at 4921 Parkview Pl (Siteman/Center for Advanced Medicine) is selected as the primary contact location.\n\nStep 4 - Address selection and normalization:\n- Chose patient-facing clinic address: 4921 Parkview Pl, Ste 7A (first listed suite from NPI practice location block), Saint Louis, MO 63110-1032. Rationale: this address appears on NPPES-derived records and is the standard outpatient Siteman/Center for Advanced Medicine location where oncology clinics are held. WashU faculty page provides a departmental mail stop (660 S Euclid Ave) but not the clinic suite for scheduling; per selection rules the clinic location is preferred for patient contact.\n\nStep 5 - Phone selection and validation:\n- WashU faculty/profile page lists Phone: 314-747-1171 and Fax: 314-362-7086; department/location pages list patient appointment lines (New Patients: 314-747-1005; current patients and other system numbers: 314-362-7216, 800-647-2098). Preference given to the faculty page phone 314-747-1171 as the most specific direct contact on the provider's official profile. 800-647-2098 noted as system scheduling fallback.\n\nStep 6 - Date extraction:\n- No explicit 'Last updated' or 'Modified' date was visible on the selected official WashU faculty profile page. The page footer shows ©2025 but no explicit modification date; therefore set to 'No date found'. NPI aggregators show recent NPI record update (e.g., 04/17/2025 on one aggregator), but the official faculty page lacked a specific update timestamp.\n\nStep 7 - Cross-verification and conflict handling:\n- Address discrepancy: departmental mail stop (660 S Euclid Ave) vs clinic location (4921 Parkview Pl). Resolved by preferring the patient-facing clinic (Parkview / Center for Advanced Medicine) per our hierarchy. Phone discrepancy: multiple numbers exist (faculty phone vs system scheduling); primary selected faculty phone with system number as fallback. All choices prefer official WashU/BJC/Siteman web properties over tertiary directories.\n\nStep 8 - Validation against NPI table affiliation (PRIMARY_AFFILIATION_NAME):\n- PRIMARY_AFFILIATION_NAME = 'WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY' (input). Web findings confirm Washington University / WashU Medicine / Siteman Cancer Center as the provider's primary affiliation. Because web result aligns with the NPI table entry and provides clinic-level detail, the decision was to retain the NPI table affiliation (organization unchanged) while recording the clinic-level address/phone for patient contact.\n\nPHONE NUMBER VALIDATION MATRIX (summary):\n- Primary office/direct line found on faculty profile: 314-747-1171 (chosen). Area code 314 matches St. Louis, MO. Cross-reference: not all location pages list the same direct extension; system scheduling numbers (314-747-1005, 314-362-7216, 800-647-2098) corroborate clinic-level contact. No personal direct mobile or unique extension publicly shown; therefore faculty office number used as specific contact and system number retained as fallback.\n\nADDRESS VALIDATION PROTOCOL (summary):\n- Clinic address components verified via NPPES-derived records and hospital/system location pages (Center for Advanced Medicine / Siteman Cancer Center). Address standardized to street, suite, city, 2-letter state, ZIP+4. Geographically consistent with NPPES practice city/state (Saint Louis, MO). Department mail stop (660 S Euclid Ave) is noted but treated as mail location rather than patient clinic location.\n\nSOURCE URL HIERARCHY & SOURCES USED:\n- Tier 1: Washington University (oncology.wustl.edu faculty profile), Siteman Cancer Center/Center for Advanced Medicine location pages, BJC/WashU Find a Doctor location pages.\n- Tier 2: NPPES-derived aggregators (hipaaspace, npidb, npino) and PECOS/clinician utilization pages for cross-checking.\n- Tier 3: Secondary provider directories used only for corroboration as needed.\n\nCONFLICT RESOLUTION FRAMEWORK APPLIED:\n- Prefer official WashU/BJC/Siteman pages for final contact info. Use most recent authoritative content where dates exist. Require at least one primary authoritative source (WashU faculty/profile and system location) to confirm address/phone. When multiple numbers exist prefer the provider-specific number on the faculty page; if absent fallback to system scheduling lines.\n\nCONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT:\n- Overall Confidence: High.\n- Confidence reasoning: Multiple authoritative sources (Washington University faculty profile, Siteman/Center for Advanced Medicine location pages, NPPES-derived records and PECOS usage data) consistently identify Dr. Saiama N. Waqar as a Medical Oncology physician affiliated with Washington University School of Medicine and Siteman Cancer Center. Clinic address and phone were corroborated across official pages and NPI records. The only minor ambiguity was the departmental mail stop vs clinic clinic address; resolved by preferring patient-facing clinic address. No contradictory evidence suggesting a different primary U.S. affiliation was found.\n\nNotes and limitations:\n- The official WashU faculty page provided a departmental/mailstop address (660 S Euclid Ave) while NPPES and patient-facing location pages indicate the outpatient clinic at 4921 Parkview Pl (Center for Advanced Medicine). I selected the patient-facing clinic address as primary contact for patients. \n- No explicit 'Last updated' timestamp found on the WashU profile page; aggregator showed a recent NPI update. If an explicit page modification date is required for auditing, a direct site contact or page owner metadata check would be needed.\n\nAll of the above steps follow the search and validation logic described in the assignment and are summarized here for reproducibility."",
