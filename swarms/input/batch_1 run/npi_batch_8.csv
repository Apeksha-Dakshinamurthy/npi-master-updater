  ""final_decision"": ""Retained NPI table affiliation"",
  ""evaluation_info"": ""AFFILIATION SELECTION REASONING:\n\n1) Identity seeding and disambiguation\n- Anchor: NPI 1003302001. NPI-derived sources (via HIPAASpace / NPI aggregators) list 'FILIP IONESCU MD' with practice locations in Tampa, FL and other historical locations (Royal Oak, MI; Morgantown, WV). Multiple directory/profile pages reference Hematology/Oncology specialty. I confirmed name match to the input (first and last name match exactly; no middle name provided).\n- State boards/licensure checks were not completed directly due to the 5-search limit; some profile snippets (Doximity, US News) referenced WV and MI licenses but I did not fetch state board pages.\n\n2) Candidate affiliation discovery\n- Priority sources searched (in order): NPI/NPPES reference pages, clinician directories (Healthgrades, EverydayHealth), institutional pages (Moffitt search), and a Mon Health news/profile indicating a potential recent move to Vandalia Health / Mon Health Cancer Center.\n- Candidate organizations discovered (names & URLs): H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center & Research Institute (multiple directory references), Mon Health / Vandalia Health (news release and find-a-doc page), and historical listings (Royal Oak / Michigan sites).\n\n3) Evidence scoring & selection\n- I observed conflicting, time-varying evidence: long-standing association with H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center (Tampa) in many directories and NPI-related records, and also a Mon Health (Vandalia Health) news item indicating a recent appointment (news page snippets showed a June 2025 date).\n- The web-found Mon Health news appeared newer than other records, but within the 5-search attempt limit I could not retrieve a clinic-level address and phone for the Mon Health profile to satisfy the address+phone validation requirements.\n\n4) Decision and tie-breaker logic applied\n- Because I could not validate a clinic-level address and direct phone for the web-found Mon Health affiliation within the allotted 5 searches, I applied the algorithm's fallback: retain the NPI-table affiliation and gather the best available contact/address for that organization.\n- This avoids selecting a different primary affiliation on the web that I cannot fully validate (address + clinic phone + profile update date) within the search limit.\n\n5) Address & phone retrieval\n- Best available, corroborated contact information for the retained affiliation was obtained from NPI-derived aggregator pages and clinician directories: primary campus address commonly listed for Moffitt is 12902 USF Magnolia Dr, Tampa, FL 33612. The NPI-aggregator page lists a practice phone 888-663-3488; this was used as the clinic/system fallback number.\n\n6) Contradictions and limitations\n- Contradiction: Some sources list alternate addresses (e.g., 4101 Jim Walter Blvd, Tampa, FL 33607-5775) in the NPI record and other directories list locations in MI and WV. A Mon Health news release suggests a recent move to Vandalia Health (Mon Health Cancer Center), which may supersede Moffitt affiliation, but I could not fetch the Mon Health clinician page with full clinic contact details within 5 searches.\n- Because of these conflicts and the limited number of searches, I retained the NPI-table affiliation (H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center) where I could supply a validated address/phone from the NPI-derived sources.\n\nPHONE NUMBER VALIDATION MATRIX (applied):\n- Phone used: NPI-aggregator practice-location phone 888-663-3488 (normalized). This is treated as a system/fallback line, not necessarily a direct provider scheduling line. Cross-reference to other official clinic pages was not available within the search limit.\n\nADDRESS VALIDATION PROTOCOL (applied):\n- Address chosen: 12902 USF Magnolia Dr, Tampa, FL 33612 (commonly listed Moffitt campus address in multiple clinician directories). The NPI-aggregator shows a different Tampa practice address (4101 Jim Walter Blvd); I flagged this discrepancy and documented it above.\n\nSOURCE URL HIERARCHY & SOURCES USED:\n- Tier 1 attempt: official hospital/clinic websites (Moffitt) — direct Moffitt provider profile was not located within 5 queries.\n- Tier 2: NPI registry aggregators and clinician directories (used to corroborate name, specialty and contact details).\n\nCONFLICT RESOLUTION FRAMEWORK:\n- Preferred official clinic pages and most recent dated content; when that could not be obtained, used NPI-derived practice location as fallback and retained NPI-table affiliation.\n\nOverall conclusion: I retained the NPI-table affiliation (H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center) because I could not fully validate a different, more-recent web affiliation (Mon Health) within the 5-search limit. All contradictions, reasoning steps, and fallback choices are documented above."",

However, there are recent web signals (Mon Health news) that suggest the provider may have moved since the NPI-table affiliation.
