  ""final_decision"": ""Chose web result"",
  ""evaluation_info"": ""AFFILIATION SELECTION REASONING:\n1) Identity seeding & disambiguation: NPI 1104203645 resolves to Azka Ali MD in multiple NPI/NPI-aggregate sources (HIPAASPACE/NPIDB). That NPI was used to anchor searches. Cleveland Clinic staff/provider pages explicitly list Azka Ali, MD as a medical oncologist in the Taussig Cancer Institute — matches name and specialty. State/geo alignment: Cleveland, OH.\n\n2) Candidate discovery: Priority sources located were Cleveland Clinic official staff/profile pages (my.clevelandclinic.org/staff/30132-azka-ali and providers.clevelandclinic.org/provider/azka-ali/4269583) and Cleveland Clinic Hematology & Medical Oncology department pages. Secondary corroboration from WebMD, WebMD group listings and PubMed affiliation lines showing Cleveland Clinic & Taussig Cancer Institute.\n\n3) Selection & tie-breakers: Official Cleveland Clinic staff/profile with appointment request and departmental contact was chosen over NPPES-aggregator because it is the authoritative clinic site, lists scheduling/appointment options and provider reviews (recent). Private practice priority did not apply — Dr. Ali is an academic/hospital-based medical oncologist. Multiple independent Cleveland Clinic pages corroborate the same affiliation and phone.\n\n4) Address & phone retrieval: The Cleveland Clinic pages indicate Taussig Cancer Institute on Cleveland Clinic Main Campus. Department-level phone (216-444-5660) is shown on the Hematology & Medical Oncology / staff listings and matches provider pages — selected as the primary clinic/department line. Address standardized to 9500 Euclid Ave, CA-060, Cleveland, OH 44195 (Taussig Cancer Institute location). Suite/CA-060 retained as address_2.\n\n5) Date/recentness: No explicit page-level 'Last updated' or 'Modified' meta date was found on the Cleveland Clinic staff page; patient review timestamps on provider pages indicate content is being updated (reviews in 2024–2025). Because no explicit page update date was visible, 'No date found' is returned for selected_affiliation_date.\n\n6) Conflicts: NPPES-aggregator entries (HIPAASPACE/NPIDB) list practice location 10201 Carnegie Ave, Cleveland, OH 44106-2130. This conflicts with Cleveland Clinic official pages listing 9500 Euclid Ave (44195). Per the source hierarchy and conflict resolution framework, the official Cleveland Clinic provider/staff pages and departmental pages are preferred over third-party NPI aggregators. Noted the contradiction and selected Cleveland Clinic main campus as the authoritative clinic location.\n\nPHONE NUMBER VALIDATION MATRIX (summary):\n- Type: Department/clinic scheduling line (preferred) — 216-444-5660.\n- Format standardized to 216-444-5660.\n- Area code (216) matches Cleveland, OH.\n- Cross-referenced on Cleveland Clinic department/staff pages (primary official source). NPPES phone entries differed (NPPES phone 662-238-1008 on aggregator) — that number does not match Cleveland Clinic official site and likely an outdated/incorrect aggregator copy; Cleveland Clinic official number chosen.\n\nADDRESS VALIDATION PROTOCOL (summary):\n- Street address: 9500 Euclid Ave (Main Campus)\n- Suite/floor: CA-060 (Taussig Cancer Institute) captured in street2\n- City/State/ZIP: Cleveland, OH 44195 — matches multiple Cleveland Clinic pages and PubMed affiliation lines\n- NPPES/aggregator lists different address (10201 Carnegie Ave, 44106) — flagged and resolved in favor of official Cleveland Clinic pages.\n\nSOURCE PRIORITY: Official Cleveland Clinic staff/provider and department pages > PubMed affiliation lines > NPPES aggregator pages.\n\nLOOP CONTROL: Stopped after 5 Tavily queries (hard stop). Collected sufficient authoritative evidence to select Cleveland Clinic Taussig Cancer Institute as primary affiliation with validated clinic phone and main campus address. Where explicit page-level update date was not found, 'No date found' returned. All steps, queries, and key contradictions are documented above."",
