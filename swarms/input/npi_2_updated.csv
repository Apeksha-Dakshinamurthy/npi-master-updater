Additional taxonomies listed: 207R00000X Internal Medicine; 207RH0000X Hematology; 207RH0003X Hematology & Oncology.\\\\n- Mailing / Practice address on NPI-derived record(s): 200 HAWKINS DR, IOWA CITY, IA 52242-1009, USA.\\\\n- Practice phone (from NPI-derived record): 319-356-2353. Fax: 319-353-8383.\\\\n\\\\nAffiliation / employer / practice location evidence:\\\\n- University of Iowa Health Care / State University of Iowa appears as primary practice affiliation. Multiple directory pages (US News, Medicarelist, and local provider profiles) list her practicing at University of Iowa Health Care / State University of Iowa (practice NPI referenced on US News: 1477554814), consistent with the 200 Hawkins Dr address (University of Iowa Hospitals & Clinics address).\\\\n- Additional listed affiliation: Jefferson County Health Center (appears on US News profile as an affiliation as well).\\\\n\\\\nLicensure and dates found:\\\\n- US News lists an Iowa State medical license and states IA State Medical License active through 2027 (this is the only explicit license expiration/active-through date found in the captured pages).\\\\n- Training dates on US News: Residency Internal Medicine 1993-1996; Fellowship Hematology & Medical Oncology 1996-1998 (background, not licensing). CMS EHR Stage entries (2011-2013) appear on US News profile.\\\\n\\\\nSpecialty / department / role:\\\\n- Specialties listed across sources: Internal Medicine; Medical Oncology (primary taxonomy); Hematology; Hematology & Oncology. Some payer/provider directories list specialty as Adult/Internal Medicine and Hematology/Oncology.\\\\n- Departmentally, likely within University of Iowa Hospitals & Clinics \\u2014 Division/Department of Internal Medicine and/or Hematology/Oncology (no explicit departmental webpage captured in searches that lists department name and schedule).\\\\n\\\\nWorking hours / schedule:\\\\n- No working hours or clinic schedule were found in the captured pages.\\\\n\\\\nPhone numbers and addresses (captured):\\\\n- Practice address: 200 Hawkins Dr, Iowa City, IA 52242-1009 (NPI-derived and matches University of Iowa location).\\\\n- Practice phone: 319-356-2353. Fax: 319-353-8383.\\\\n\\\\nEvidence that information is current / provenance:\\\\n- NPI record (NPPES-derived viewers) listing NPI 1487615340 with current practice address and taxonomies \\u2014 authoritative for NPI-linked practice information.\\\\n- US News profile repeats NPI and lists IA license active through 2027 (provides an explicit license active-through date).\\\\n- Health Alliance / Medicarelist provider pages corroborate NPI and affiliation (University of Iowa / State University of Iowa) and specialties.\\\\n\\\\nNotes and limitations:\\\\n- I reached the maximum allowed Tavily search calls for this task; I did not query the Iowa Board of Medicine site directly (which would be the authoritative state board source) within these searches. US News lists the IA license active through 2027, but direct verification on the Iowa Board of Medicine licensure lookup is recommended for the authoritative license status and exact issuance/expiration dates.\\\\n- No explicit clinic department page with working hours or an official University of Iowa provider profile page (with last-updated timestamp) was captured within the five-search limit; directory pages and aggregated NPI viewers were the primary sources.\\\\n\\\\nRecommended next steps (if you want further verification):\\\\n1) Query the Iowa Board of Medicine license lookup for \\\\\\\""Susan L Roeder\\\\\\\"" (and former name Roman) to confirm active license details and dates.\\\\n2) Visit the official University of Iowa Health Care provider directory or departmental Hematology/Oncology faculty/provider pages to confirm departmental affiliation, role/title, and clinic hours.  \\\"",\\n  \\\""tavily_search_results\\\"": [\\n    {\\n      \\\""query\\\"": \\\""SUSAN L ROEDER NPI 1487615340 NPPES state board Internal Medicine\\\"",\\n      \\\""results\\\"": [\\n        {\\n          \\\""title\\\"": \\\""State University Of Iowa in Iowa City, IA - Medicare Family Medicine\\\"",\\n          \\\""url\\\"": \\\""https://www.medicarelist.com/primary-care/university-of-iowa-hospitals-clinics-medical-service-plan-iowa-city-ia/\\\"",\\n          \\\""content\\\"": \\\""|  |  |\\\\n --- |\\\\n| Provider Name | Susan L Roeder |\\\\n| Provider Type | Practitioner - Medical Oncology |\\\\n| Provider Identifiers | NPI Number: 1487615340 PECOS PAC ID: 7416021548 Enrollment ID: I20080807000091 |\\\\n\\\\n|  |  |\\\\n --- |\\\\n| Provider Name | Anil A Marian |\\\\n| Provider Type | Practitioner - Anesthesiology |\\\\n| Provider Identifiers | NPI Number: 1760609846 PECOS PAC ID: 1456445824 Enrollment ID: I20080807000169 |\\\"",\\n          \\\""metadata\\\"": {\\n            \\\""score\\\"": 0.8156003\\n          }\\n        },\\n        {\\n          \\\""title\\\"": \\\""Dr. Susan L.

Fax: 319-353-8383.\\n\\nAffiliation / employer / practice location evidence:\\n- University of Iowa Health Care / State University of Iowa appears as primary practice affiliation. Multiple directory pages (US News, Medicarelist, and local provider profiles) list her practicing at University of Iowa Health Care / State University of Iowa (practice NPI referenced on US News: 1477554814), consistent with the 200 Hawkins Dr address (University of Iowa Hospitals & Clinics address).\\n- Additional listed affiliation: Jefferson County Health Center (appears on US News profile as an affiliation as well).\\n\\nLicensure and dates found:\\n- US News lists an Iowa State medical license and states IA State Medical License active through 2027 (this is the only explicit license expiration/active-through date found in the captured pages).\\n- Training dates on US News: Residency Internal Medicine 1993-1996; Fellowship Hematology & Medical Oncology 1996-1998 (background, not licensing). CMS EHR Stage entries (2011-2013) appear on US News profile.\\n\\nSpecialty / department / role:\\n- Specialties listed across sources: Internal Medicine; Medical Oncology (primary taxonomy); Hematology; Hematology & Oncology. Some payer/provider directories list specialty as Adult/Internal Medicine and Hematology/Oncology.\\n- Departmentally, likely within University of Iowa Hospitals & Clinics \u2014 Division/Department of Internal Medicine and/or Hematology/Oncology (no explicit departmental webpage captured in searches that lists department name and schedule).\\n\\nWorking hours / schedule:\\n- No working hours or clinic schedule were found in the captured pages.\\n\\nPhone numbers and addresses (captured):\\n- Practice address: 200 Hawkins Dr, Iowa City, IA 52242-1009 (NPI-derived and matches University of Iowa location).\\n- Practice phone: 319-356-2353.

US News lists the IA license active through 2027, but direct verification on the Iowa Board of Medicine licensure lookup is recommended for the authoritative license status and exact issuance/expiration dates.\\n- No explicit clinic department page with working hours or an official University of Iowa provider profile page (with last-updated timestamp) was captured within the five-search limit; directory pages and aggregated NPI viewers were the primary sources.\\n\\nRecommended next steps (if you want further verification):\\n1) Query the Iowa Board of Medicine license lookup for \\\""Susan L Roeder\\\"" (and former name Roman) to confirm active license details and dates.\\n2) Visit the official University of Iowa Health Care provider directory or departmental Hematology/Oncology faculty/provider pages to confirm departmental affiliation, role/title, and clinic hours.  \"",\n  \""tavily_search_results\"": [\n    {\n      \""query\"": \""SUSAN L ROEDER NPI 1487615340 NPPES state board Internal Medicine\"",\n      \""results\"": [\n        {\n          \""title\"": \""State University Of Iowa in Iowa City, IA - Medicare Family Medicine\"",\n          \""url\"": \""https://www.medicarelist.com/primary-care/university-of-iowa-hospitals-clinics-medical-service-plan-iowa-city-ia/\"",\n          \""content\"": \""|  |  |\\n --- |\\n| Provider Name | Susan L Roeder |\\n| Provider Type | Practitioner - Medical Oncology |\\n| Provider Identifiers | NPI Number: 1487615340 PECOS PAC ID: 7416021548 Enrollment ID: I20080807000091 |\\n\\n|  |  |\\n --- |\\n| Provider Name | Anil A Marian |\\n| Provider Type | Practitioner - Anesthesiology |\\n| Provider Identifiers | NPI Number: 1760609846 PECOS PAC ID: 1456445824 Enrollment ID: I20080807000169 |\"",\n          \""metadata\"": {\n            \""score\"": 0.8156003\n          }\n        },\n        {\n          \""title\"": \""Dr. Susan L.

US News lists the IA license active through 2027, but direct verification on the Iowa Board of Medicine licensure lookup is recommended for the authoritative license status and exact issuance/expiration dates.\\\\n- No explicit clinic department page with working hours or an official University of Iowa provider profile page (with last-updated timestamp) was captured within the five-search limit; directory pages and aggregated NPI viewers were the primary sources.\\\\n\\\\nRecommended next steps (if you want further verification):\\\\n1) Query the Iowa Board of Medicine license lookup for \\\\\\\""Susan L Roeder\\\\\\\"" (and former name Roman) to confirm active license details and dates.\\\\n2) Visit the official University of Iowa Health Care provider directory or departmental Hematology/Oncology faculty/provider pages to confirm departmental affiliation, role/title, and clinic hours.  \\\"",\\n  \\\""tavily_search_results\\\"": [\\n    {\\n      \\\""query\\\"": \\\""SUSAN L ROEDER NPI 1487615340 NPPES state board Internal Medicine\\\"",\\n      \\\""results\\\"": [\\n        {\\n          \\\""title\\\"": \\\""State University Of Iowa in Iowa City, IA - Medicare Family Medicine\\\"",\\n          \\\""url\\\"": \\\""https://www.medicarelist.com/primary-care/university-of-iowa-hospitals-clinics-medical-service-plan-iowa-city-ia/\\\"",\\n          \\\""content\\\"": \\\""|  |  |\\\\n --- |\\\\n| Provider Name | Susan L Roeder |\\\\n| Provider Type | Practitioner - Medical Oncology |\\\\n| Provider Identifiers | NPI Number: 1487615340 PECOS PAC ID: 7416021548 Enrollment ID: I20080807000091 |\\\\n\\\\n|  |  |\\\\n --- |\\\\n| Provider Name | Anil A Marian |\\\\n| Provider Type | Practitioner - Anesthesiology |\\\\n| Provider Identifiers | NPI Number: 1760609846 PECOS PAC ID: 1456445824 Enrollment ID: I20080807000169 |\\\"",\\n          \\\""metadata\\\"": {\\n            \\\""score\\\"": 0.8156003\\n          }\\n        },\\n        {\\n          \\\""title\\\"": \\\""Dr. Susan L.

Additional taxonomies listed: 207R00000X Internal Medicine; 207RH0000X Hematology; 207RH0003X Hematology & Oncology.\\\\n- Mailing / Practice address on NPI-derived record(s): 200 HAWKINS DR, IOWA CITY, IA 52242-1009, USA.\\\\n- Practice phone (from NPI-derived record): 319-356-2353. Fax: 319-353-8383.\\\\n\\\\nAffiliation / employer / practice location evidence:\\\\n- University of Iowa Health Care / State University of Iowa appears as primary practice affiliation. Multiple directory pages (US News, Medicarelist, and local provider profiles) list her practicing at University of Iowa Health Care / State University of Iowa (practice NPI referenced on US News: 1477554814), consistent with the 200 Hawkins Dr address (University of Iowa Hospitals & Clinics address).\\\\n- Additional listed affiliation: Jefferson County Health Center (appears on US News profile as an affiliation as well).\\\\n\\\\nLicensure and dates found:\\\\n- US News lists an Iowa State medical license and states IA State Medical License active through 2027 (this is the only explicit license expiration/active-through date found in the captured pages).\\\\n- Training dates on US News: Residency Internal Medicine 1993-1996; Fellowship Hematology & Medical Oncology 1996-1998 (background, not licensing). CMS EHR Stage entries (2011-2013) appear on US News profile.\\\\n\\\\nSpecialty / department / role:\\\\n- Specialties listed across sources: Internal Medicine; Medical Oncology (primary taxonomy); Hematology; Hematology & Oncology. Some payer/provider directories list specialty as Adult/Internal Medicine and Hematology/Oncology.\\\\n- Departmentally, likely within University of Iowa Hospitals & Clinics \\u2014 Division/Department of Internal Medicine and/or Hematology/Oncology (no explicit departmental webpage captured in searches that lists department name and schedule).\\\\n\\\\nWorking hours / schedule:\\\\n- No working hours or clinic schedule were found in the captured pages.\\\\n\\\\nPhone numbers and addresses (captured):\\\\n- Practice address: 200 Hawkins Dr, Iowa City, IA 52242-1009 (NPI-derived and matches University of Iowa location).\\\\n- Practice phone: 319-356-2353. Fax: 319-353-8383.\\\\n\\\\nEvidence that information is current / provenance:\\\\n- NPI record (NPPES-derived viewers) listing NPI 1487615340 with current practice address and taxonomies \\u2014 authoritative for NPI-linked practice information.\\\\n- US News profile repeats NPI and lists IA license active through 2027 (provides an explicit license active-through date).\\\\n- Health Alliance / Medicarelist provider pages corroborate NPI and affiliation (University of Iowa / State University of Iowa) and specialties.\\\\n\\\\nNotes and limitations:\\\\n- I reached the maximum allowed Tavily search calls for this task; I did not query the Iowa Board of Medicine site directly (which would be the authoritative state board source) within these searches. US News lists the IA license active through 2027, but direct verification on the Iowa Board of Medicine licensure lookup is recommended for the authoritative license status and exact issuance/expiration dates.\\\\n- No explicit clinic department page with working hours or an official University of Iowa provider profile page (with last-updated timestamp) was captured within the five-search limit; directory pages and aggregated NPI viewers were the primary sources.\\\\n\\\\nRecommended next steps (if you want further verification):\\\\n1) Query the Iowa Board of Medicine license lookup for \\\\\\\""Susan L Roeder\\\\\\\"" (and former name Roman) to confirm active license details and dates.\\\\n2) Visit the official University of Iowa Health Care provider directory or departmental Hematology/Oncology faculty/provider pages to confirm departmental affiliation, role/title, and clinic hours.  \\\"",\\n  \\\""tavily_search_results\\\"": [\\n    {\\n      \\\""query\\\"": \\\""SUSAN L ROEDER NPI 1487615340 NPPES state board Internal Medicine\\\"",\\n      \\\""results\\\"": [\\n        {\\n          \\\""title\\\"": \\\""State University Of Iowa in Iowa City, IA - Medicare Family Medicine\\\"",\\n          \\\""url\\\"": \\\""https://www.medicarelist.com/primary-care/university-of-iowa-hospitals-clinics-medical-service-plan-iowa-city-ia/\\\"",\\n          \\\""content\\\"": \\\""|  |  |\\\\n --- |\\\\n| Provider Name | Susan L Roeder |\\\\n| Provider Type | Practitioner - Medical Oncology |\\\\n| Provider Identifiers | NPI Number: 1487615340 PECOS PAC ID: 7416021548 Enrollment ID: I20080807000091 |\\\\n\\\\n|  |  |\\\\n --- |\\\\n| Provider Name | Anil A Marian |\\\\n| Provider Type | Practitioner - Anesthesiology |\\\\n| Provider Identifiers | NPI Number: 1760609846 PECOS PAC ID: 1456445824 Enrollment ID: I20080807000169 |\\\"",\\n          \\\""metadata\\\"": {\\n            \\\""score\\\"": 0.8156003\\n          }\\n        },\\n        {\\n          \\\""title\\\"": \\\""Dr. Susan L.

  ""final_decision"": ""Chose web result"",
  ""evaluation_info"": ""5.1 AFFILIATION SELECTION REASONING\n\nStep 1: Primary Affiliation Identification (Private Practice Priority)\n- I seeded identity with NPI 1669479853 (NPPES) which lists MARK DAVID LOGSDON M.D., taxonomy Radiation Oncology Physician (2085R0001X), practice location 2825 Capitol Ave Ste 502, Sacramento, CA. That established geography and specialty.\n- Although the input PRIMARY_AFFILIATION_NAME is \""SUTTER VALLEY MEDICAL FOUNDATION,\"" web sources (Sutter Health provider profile and related listings) show Dr. Logsdon practicing at a Sutter-affiliated clinic (Sutter Medical Group / Sutter Medical Plaza) at the same Capitol Ave address. This is consistent with the NPI practice location.\n\nStep 2: Web-Chosen vs Primary Affiliation Analysis\n- Recency: NPPES last updated 2018-07-23 for the NPI record; the Sutter Health provider profile appears active (no explicit page-level date found). Multiple current provider directories (Sutter Health, Marshall Medical, Doximity) list the same address and phone, indicating the clinician is presently associated with Sutter-affiliated services. No explicit \""last updated\"" on the Sutter profile, so I recorded \""No date found\"" for the affiliation page.\n- Authority: Sutter Health site is Tier 1 (official hospital/clinic website). NPPES is authoritative for NPI record. Marshall Medical (health system site) and Doximity corroborate contact details.\n- Consistency: Address (2825 Capitol Ave Ste 502), phone (916-454-6600), specialty (Radiation Oncology) match across multiple sources.\n- Specificity: The Sutter provider profile shows physician-specific listing; Marshall Medical page also lists same clinic and contact details.\n\nStep 3: Conflict Resolution\n- The NPI-table affiliation provided (SUTTER VALLEY MEDICAL FOUNDATION) and web-found affiliation (Sutter Medical Group / Sutter Health at Capitol Ave) are not contradictory; Sutter Valley Medical Foundation is a Sutter-affiliated entity and the web evidence shows active practice within the Sutter network. Because web sources are current and authoritative and the NPPES record is older, I selected the web result (Sutter Medical Group/Sutter Health at 2825 Capitol Ave) as the primary affiliation for contact/address extraction.\n\n5.2 PHONE NUMBER VALIDATION MATRIX\n- Types checked: Primary office/scheduling number (916-454-6600) appears as the clinic/main number on NPPES-derived records, Doximity, Marshall Medical, and Sutter page. No direct personal line or extension was found publicly.\n- Format: Normalized to 916-454-6600.\n- Area code matches Sacramento, CA.\n- Cross-reference: same number appears on multiple authoritative sources (NPPES-derived XML/records, Sutter Health listing, Marshall Medical group page).\n- Conclusion: 916-454-6600 is the most accurate clinic/scheduling number for the selected clinic address. No provider direct line or extension publicly shown, so the clinic main line was chosen per hierarchy.\n\n5.3 ADDRESS VALIDATION PROTOCOL\n- Address components found and standardized from NPPES-derived sources and Sutter/Marshall pages: 2825 Capitol Ave, Ste 502, Sacramento, CA 95816.\n- Suite recorded as address_2: Ste 502.\n- Verified consistency across NPPES records, Marshall Medical listing, Doximity and Sutter provider page.\n- No conflicting alternate primary address found for this clinician in the searches performed.\n\n5.4 SOURCE URL HIERARCHY\n- Tier 1 sources used: Sutter Health provider profile (selected_affiliation_source_url), NPPES provider-view (npiregistry.cms.hhs.gov provider page), Marshall Medical group provider page.\n- Tier 2 used for corroboration: Doximity and other provider directories.\n- Tier 3 not used as primary evidence except for corroboration where necessary.\n\n5.5 CONFLICT RESOLUTION FRAMEWORK\n- Where differences could exist between the NPI-table affiliation name and web-found affiliation, I examined recency and authority. NPPES record is older (2018) while Sutter profile and health system listings are current and authoritative for contacting patients. Because the Sutter listing is the active booking/clinic listing at the same address and phone, I selected it as the primary web result. Any minor naming differences (Sutter Valley Medical Foundation vs Sutter Medical Group / Sutter Health) are within the same health system; I prioritized the direct clinic/hospital site for address/phone extraction.\n\n5.6 CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT\nOverall Confidence: High\n- Rationale: Multiple Tier-1/Tier-2 authoritative sources (Sutter Health provider page, NPPES registry, Marshall Medical provider page, Doximity) consistently report the same street address and clinic phone number. Name (including middle name/initial), specialty (Radiation Oncology), city/state (Sacramento, CA) and phone all match. The only minor gap is lack of an explicit \""last updated\"" date on the Sutter profile page; however the consistency across authoritative sources supports high confidence in correctness of the selected affiliation, address, and phone.\n\nNote on NPI-table affiliation: The input PRIMARY_AFFILIATION_NAME \""SUTTER VALLEY MEDICAL FOUNDATION\"" is a Sutter-affiliated entity and not materially different for patient contact from the web-found Sutter Medical Group / Sutter Medical Plaza clinic. I selected the Sutter web clinic listing as the best single site for address and phone extraction.\n\nAll of the above steps, heuristics, and the source hierarchy were applied in selection and validation."",

  ""evaluation_info"": ""AFFILIATION SELECTION REASONING\n\nStep 0 - Tooling and seed: I started with the NPI as the anchor to seed identity and practice location. I used Tavily for all lookups and tracked queries used.\n\nStep 1 - Identity seeding and disambiguation:\n- Queried the NPI (1992948152) to pull NPPES-like info (search: \""NPI 1992948152 NPPES\""). Result sources (HIPAASpace extract of NPPES data) listed practice location 5841 S Maryland Ave, Chicago IL 60637 and a phone of 888-824-0200 (system appointments). This anchored the provider to University of Chicago Medicine (Hyde Park).\n- Confirmed provider name as Ardaman Shergill on University of Chicago Medicine site and University directory. Directory includes phone, mail code, and affiliation lines showing Assistant Professor of Medicine; Department: Medicine, Hematology/Oncology. No conflicting name variants found. NPI-derived geography (Chicago, IL) aligns.\n- Checked state medical board was not necessary beyond alignment because multiple authoritative University pages confirm active faculty/clinical appointment; no contradictory licensing/name issues were found.\n\nStep 2 - Candidate affiliation discovery:\n- Priority sources located: UChicago Medicine physician profile (Find-a-Physician page), University of Chicago directory, and Biological Sciences Division faculty page. These are Tier 1 (official hospital/clinic and academic) and list Dr. Shergill.\n- Candidate organizations collected: UChicago Medicine / The University of Chicago Medical Center (physician profile), University of Chicago Biological Sciences Division (faculty page).\n\nStep 3 - Select a single top affiliation (scoring and tie-breakers):\n- Evidence priority: Official UChicago Medicine physician profile page lists the provider, appointment request link, and location; University directory lists direct phone and mail code. Both are authoritative and consistent. These satisfy priorities (hospital/health system + academic appointment with direct clinic listing).\n- Recency: No explicit page-level \""last updated\"" timestamp found on the profile pages returned. However, multiple active appointment/scheduling signals and current departmental listings indicate an active, current affiliation.\n- Tie-breaker: UChicago Medicine physician profile is the official clinical profile (bookable/appointment link and system appointment number). University directory provides a narrower phone line and departmental address. Combined, they form consistent evidence.\n- Selected top affiliation: UChicago Medicine (The University of Chicago Medical Center) — this matches the NPI table PRIMARY_AFFILIATION_NAME.\n\nStep 4 - Retrieve address for the top affiliation only:\n- Primary source: UChicago Medicine physician profile lists location as 5841 S. Maryland Avenue, Chicago, IL 60637. The University directory lists address as 5841 S. Maryland, MC 2115, Chicago, IL 60637. NPPES-derived entry shows 5841 S MARYLAND AVE CHICAGO IL 60637-1443. I selected the clinic address as shown on the physician profile and included MC 2115 as address_2 (mail code) from the directory.\n- Normalized street and components to USPS-style; used 2-letter state code IL and 5-digit ZIP 60637 (NPPES also shows a 9-digit variant 60637-1443; official profile shows 60637 so 5-digit used).\n\nStep 5 - Retrieve the most accurate phone for that exact clinic address:\n- Sources: UChicago Medicine physician profile shows \""Appointments: 1-888-824-0200\"" (system scheduling). University directory (official campus directory) lists a direct phone (773-702-4274) and fax (773-702-3163). UChicago main switchboard 773-702-1000 is also present on site pages.\n- Preference applied: direct clinic/department line (773-702-4274) chosen over the general appointment line because it appears on the official university directory as Dr. Shergill's office contact. System appointment line is noted as alternate.\n\nStep 6 - Date extraction:\n- No explicit \""Last updated\"" or published/modified dates were found on the UChicago Medicine profile, University directory, or Biological Sciences faculty page. Therefore, set selected_affiliation_date to \""No date found\"".\n\nStep 7 - Validation, normalization, quality checks:\n- NAME: Verified exact name match to input (ARDAMAN SHERGILL); no middle name present online — passes.\n- SPECIALTY: Verified Hematology/Oncology / Medical Oncology on multiple UChicago pages; aligns with clinical expectations.\n- ADDRESS: Contains street, city, 2-letter state (IL), and ZIP 60637; matches NPPES; MC 2115 included as secondary address component.\n- PHONE: Normalized to 10-digit US format (773-702-4274). Cross-checked against UChicago directory and physician profile (which uses system appointment line). NPPES phone (as surfaced in secondary source) shows 888-824-0200 (appointments); used as corroboration for system scheduling but not selected as primary direct contact.\n- Cross-verification: Address and phone confirmed across at least two independent official sources (UChicago Medicine physician profile + University directory + NPPES record for the address). No major conflicts.\n\nStep 8 - Validation against NPI table (PRIMARY_AFFILIATION_NAME):\n- The PRIMARY_AFFILIATION_NAME provided (THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO MEDICAL CENTER) aligns with the web-found affiliation (UChicago Medicine / The University of Chicago Medical Center). Because they match, and web evidence is authoritative, the final decision is to retain the NPI table affiliation.\n\nStep 9 - Loop control and stopping conditions:\n- Stopped after finding a qualified top affiliation with validated address and phone. Total Tavily queries used: 3. recursion_limit_reached set to false.\n\nStep 10 - Contradictions and reasoning:\n- Minor differences: NPPES-derived phone sometimes shows the central appointment line (888-824-0200) while directory shows a direct clinic line (773-702-4274). I preferred direct clinic line for reachability. ZIP has 9-digit form in one data source (60637-1443) but official profile and directory use 60637; I used the standard 5-digit ZIP 60637 and included MC 2115 as secondary address.\n- All decisions prioritize official university/health system pages; third-party directory data was used only for corroboration.\n\nPHONE NUMBER VALIDATION MATRIX (summary):\n- Phone types checked: system appointment (1-888-824-0200), main hospital (773-702-1000), direct office (773-702-4274), fax (773-702-3163). Selected 773-702-4274 as the most direct office line tied to the directory and faculty listing. Formatting normalized to 773-702-4274.\n\nADDRESS VALIDATION PROTOCOL (summary):\n- Street: 5841 S. Maryland Ave (confirmed on UChicago pages). Suite/mail code: MC 2115 taken from university directory. City/State/Zip confirmed and consistent with NPPES.\n\nSOURCE URL HIERARCHY used (summary):\n- Tier 1: UChicago Medicine physician profile (used as primary clinical profile), University of Chicago directory (direct contact and departmental mailing info), Biological Sciences faculty page.\n- Tier 2/3: NPPES-derived data via HIPAA-space listing used to corroborate practice location and system appointment number.\n\nCONFLICT RESOLUTION FRAMEWORK (applied):\n- Date missing across pages -> used multiple official sources and recency signals (active appointment booking links, departmental listings) to assert current affiliation.\n- For conflicting phone numbers, prioritized direct office line on official university directory over system appointment number for clinician-level contact.\n\nConfidence assessment: see confidence_level_assessment field below.\n\nSOURCES and NOTES: Official UChicago Medicine physician profile, University of Chicago directory entry for Ardaman Shergill, Biological Sciences Division faculty page referencing clinical interests and role, and NPPES-derived listing (seen via HIPAASpace search result) for practice address and appointment number. No explicit page update/publish date found on primary profile pages.\n"",

  ""evaluation_info"": ""AFFILIATION SELECTION REASONING:\n1) Identity seeding & disambiguation: Searched using full name + NPI to anchor identity. Results consistently returned a radiation oncologist in Sacramento, CA named Richard K. Valicenti matching the input (middle initial present). NPPES/registry references and physician directories point to UC Davis Health. \n\n2) Candidate discovery: Top authoritative candidate organizations found: UC Davis Health / UC Davis Medical Center (department pages / physician profile), US News physician profile, NPI/third-party directories (npidb). Priority given to UC Davis Health official pages as primary source. \n\n3) Selection & tie-breakers: UC Davis physician profile (official clinic system page) was chosen as the top affiliation due to authority and consistency with publications listing the provider at UC Davis. Private practice was not indicated; physician is faculty/department at UC Davis. \n\n4) Address & phone retrieval: Official UC Davis profile snippet shows 4301 X St, Sacramento, CA 95817 (used as selected address). Phone number found on US News profile (916-734-8295) and appears to be the clinic contact for the physician's office. There is a street-number discrepancy between UC Davis (4301 X St) and US News (4501 X St) — both share Sacramento, CA 95817; official UC Davis page was preferred. \n\n5) Dates & recency: No \""last updated\"" or modification date was visible in retrieved snippets; therefore set to 'No date found'. \n\n6) Conflicts & resolution: Where addresses conflicted (4301 vs 4501 X St), official UC Davis Health page was prioritized. Phone number was taken from US News as a corroborating source; full confirmation of clinic direct line on the UC Davis page could not be completed within the search attempt limit. \n\nPHONE NUMBER VALIDATION MATRIX SUMMARY:\n- Type found: Practice/scheduling/office line on US News listing.\n- Format normalized to 916-734-8295.\n- Area code (916) matches Sacramento location.\n- Cross-referencing limited to US News and UC Davis snippets; recommend calling the UC Davis clinic to confirm direct scheduling number and extension if needed. \n\nADDRESS VALIDATION PROTOCOL SUMMARY:\n- Components: street (4301 X St), city (Sacramento), state (CA), ZIP (95817) captured from UC Davis profile snippet. Suite/floor not listed. \n- Conflict: US News shows 4501 X St; ZIP/city/state consistent. Preferred UC Davis official page. Recommend phone confirmation for absolute accuracy. \n\nSOURCE URL HIERARCHY & SITUATION:\n- Primary source used: UC Davis Health physician/team page (official clinic/hospital site) — highest authority.\n- Secondary corroboration: US News physician profile and npidb/other NPI directory entries. \n\nCONSTRAINTS & LIMITATIONS:\n- Searches exhausted the allowed 5 Tavily queries; recursion_limit_reached is true. Additional direct confirmation (calling clinic, opening UC Davis page to extract explicit phone/address sections and modification date) was not possible within the search limit. \n\nRECOMMENDATION:\n- For operational use (scheduling, mapping, credentialing), call 916-734-8295 to confirm the clinic location and ask to confirm the mailing/street address (4301 vs 4501 X St) and whether Dr. Richard K. Valicenti sees patients at that address. If a definitive clinic number appears on UC Davis site, prefer that for final records and update accordingly."",

  ""final_decision"": ""Chose web result"",
  ""evaluation_info"": ""Step-by-step reasoning and checks performed:\n\n1) Identity seeding & disambiguation\n- Seeded with NPI 1134221070. NPI-derived sources (npino.com, HIPAASpace) list provider as \""Boon Yee Chew, MD\"", taxonomy 207RH0003X (Hematology & Oncology), practice city Daytona Beach, FL and a practice address at 303 N Clyde Morris Blvd (Halifax Regional Oncology Center / Halifax). These results match the input name (including middle name 'Yee' in NPI-derived sources) and specialty (Medical Oncology / Hematology & Oncology).\n- Searched Halifax Health site for provider profile and found an official Halifax Health staff profile for \""Boon Chew, MD\"" listing Primary Specialty: Cancer Care and Primary Location: Charles L. and Miki N. Grant Cancer Center for Hope – Daytona Beach at 303 N. Clyde Morris Blvd., Daytona Beach, FL. This aligns geographically with NPPES/NPI-derived records.\n\n2) Candidate affiliation discovery\n- Priority sources discovered (in order of trust):\n  * Halifax Health staff profile (halifaxhealth.org/staff/boon-chew) — direct hospital/system profile listing specialty and primary location.\n  * Halifax Health location page for Charles L. and Miki N. Grant Cancer Center for Hope (halifaxhealth.org/locations/charles-l-and-miki-n-grant-cancer-center-for-hope-daytona-beach) — location page with address & phone.\n  * NPI aggregator pages (npino.com, HIPAASpace) presenting NPI details and listing Halifax Regional Oncology Center address and a phone.\n  * NPI Dashboard listing associated hospitals including Halifax Health/Halifax Hospital Medical Center.\n\n3) Selection and tie-breakers\n- Official Halifax Health staff profile + Halifax location page provide the strongest, authoritative evidence the physician currently practices at Halifax Health's cancer center in Daytona Beach. These are direct system/clinic pages and show appointment/clinic context.\n- The NPI/NPPES-derived aggregator pages corroborate the address and specialty; some aggregator phone values differ (see phone contradictions below). Given the authority of the Halifax Health pages and the geographic match to NPI records, I selected the Halifax Health cancer center as the top affiliation.\n\n4) Address retrieval & normalization\n- Source: Halifax Health location and staff pages both list 303 N. Clyde Morris Blvd., Daytona Beach, FL 32114. NPI aggregator pages also list 303 N Clyde Morris Blvd with ZIP 32114-2709. Chosen normalized USPS-style address: street1 303 N. Clyde Morris Blvd.; street2 set as the clinic name (Charles L. and Miki N. Grant Cancer Center for Hope); city Daytona Beach; state FL; zip 32114.\n- Address cross-verified across Halifax staff page, Halifax location page, and NPI aggregator pages (npino/hipaaspace). Address_check = true.\n\n5) Phone retrieval & validation\n- Halifax location page lists Phone: 386.425.4210 for the Cancer Center (Tier 1 official location page). Halifax staff page includes a telephone fragment in search snippet that appears as 386-425-4211 (formatting in snippet looked corrupted), and the Halifax main contact number is 386.425.4000. NPI aggregator pages (npino/hipaaspace) list a different phone: 386-254-4212.\n- Preference order used: clinic/location page phone > staff-profile phone > main switchboard > NPPES/aggregator phones. I selected 386-425-4210 (normalized 386-425-4210) from the Halifax location page as the most accurate clinic-level number.\n- Cross-source phone consistency: conflicting numbers exist (386-425-4210 vs 386-425-4211 vs 386-254-4212). Only the Halifax location page shows 386-425-4210 (official clinic page). Because the location page is an authoritative source with booking/contact info, I selected that number but could not fully corroborate the exact clinic line across two independent Tier-1 pages (staff page snippet formatting ambiguous and aggregator pages differ). Therefore phone_direct_contact_check = false (not fully cross-verified across 2+ authoritative sources). If a more conservative fallback were needed, main switchboard 386-425-4000 is also available on Halifax pages.\n\n6) Date extraction\n- No explicit \""Last updated\"" or \""Profile updated\"" date was found on the Halifax staff profile or location page. Halifax press/news items related to the cancer center were found (example press release dated Dec 15, 2023), but no page-level modified/published date on the profile or the location page itself. Per instructions, set selected_affiliation_date = \""No date found\"".\n\n7) NPI table (PRIMARY_AFFILIATION_NAME) comparison & final decision\n- Input PRIMARY_AFFILIATION_NAME: \""HALIFAX HOSPITAL MEDICAL CENTER\"" (NPI table). Web-found affiliation is Halifax Health's Charles L. and Miki N. Grant Cancer Center for Hope (Daytona Beach), part of Halifax Health / Halifax Hospital Medical Center.\n- The web result is a more specific site-level affiliation under the same system. Given Halifax Health pages are authoritative and recent system-level content exists (2023 press release), I selected the web result as the primary affiliation for this provider (final_decision: \""Chose web result\"").\n\n8) Conflicts and resolution\n- Phone: aggregator sites (npino/hipaaspace) list 386-254-4212; Halifax location page lists 386-425-4210; staff page snippet suggests 386-425-4211 but has formatting issues. Resolved by preferring the clinic location page (Halifax Health) over aggregators. Noted the contradiction in evaluation_info and set phone_direct_contact_check = false to indicate incomplete corroboration.\n- Name: NPPES/aggregator pages list full legal name \""Boon Yee Chew\""; Halifax staff page shows \""Boon Chew, MD\"". This is acceptable for identity matching; name_check = true.\n\n9) Source hierarchy used (Tier 1 prioritized):\n- Halifax Health official staff profile (primary source for provider affiliation)\n- Halifax Health location page (primary source for address + phone)\n- NPI / aggregator pages (npino.com, hipaaspace) for corroboration\n- NPI Dashboard for hospital affiliations list\n\n10) Search behavior & loop control\n- Per instructions, used Tavily for all lookups and stopped after 5 queries (hard stop). recursion_limit_reached = true.\n\nPHONE NUMBER VALIDATION MATRIX (summary)\n- Phone chosen: 386-425-4210 (format XXX-XXX-XXXX). Source: Halifax location page (clinic-level). Area code 386 matches Daytona Beach region. Extension none.\n- Cross-reference: aggregator sites show a different phone (386-254-4212). Staff-profile snippet ambiguous (possible 386-425-4211). Because the location page is an official clinic page with contact details, it is preferred despite lacking a second Tier-1 corroborating page for the exact clinic line.\n\nADDRESS VALIDATION PROTOCOL (summary)\n- Street, city, state, zip verified across Halifax staff profile, Halifax location page, and NPI aggregator pages. Address normalized to USPS format. No conflicting addresses found.\n\nSOURCE URL HIERARCHY (sources consulted)\n- Primary: https://halifaxhealth.org/staff/boon-chew (provider profile)\n- Primary location: https://halifaxhealth.org/locations/charles-l-and-miki-n-grant-cancer-center-for-hope-daytona-beach\n- Corroboration: https://npino.com/npi/1134221070-dr.-boon-yee-chew/\n- Corroboration: https://www.hipaaspace.com/medical_billing/coding/national_provider_identifier/codes/npi_1134221070.aspx\n- Corroboration / affiliations listing: https://www.npidashboard.com/npi/affiliatedhospitals/1134221070-dr-boon-y-chew-md\n\nCONFLICT RESOLUTION FRAMEWORK applied\n- Prioritized hospital/clinic official pages and recent system updates.\n- When phone conflicts existed, used clinic location page phone as authoritative; flagged lack of secondary confirmation.\n\n11) Final outputs & metadata\n- selected_affiliation: Charles L. and Miki N. Grant Cancer Center for Hope – Daytona Beach (Halifax Health / Halifax Hospital Medical Center)\n- Address: 303 N. Clyde Morris Blvd., Charles L. and Miki N. Grant Cancer Center for Hope, Daytona Beach, FL 32114\n- Phone: 386-425-4210 (clinic line per Halifax location page)\n- selected_affiliation_date: No date found (no page-level Last updated/Pub date found on profile/location pages)\n\n12) Additional notes & recommended next steps\n- If absolute phone corroboration is required, calling Halifax main switchboard (386-425-4000) or the cancer center number (386-425-4210) to confirm provider-specific scheduling line and extension is recommended.\n- If an exact page-level \""last updated\"" date is required for audit, reach out to Halifax Health web admins or capture page metadata via site admin logs.\n\nEvaluation steps included in this evaluation_info follow the required sections 5.1–5.6 (Primary Affiliation Identification rules, Web-Chosen vs Primary Affiliation Analysis, Conflict Resolution, Phone/Address validation matrices, Source URL hierarchy, Conflict Resolution framework, and Confidence assessment basis)."",
